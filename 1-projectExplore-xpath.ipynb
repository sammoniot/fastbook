      "solid weeks.\n",
      "Really? I didn't think he'd miss this \n",
      "apartment that much.\n",
      "Oh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew \n",
      "where he was I'd go talk to him.\n",
      "Oh, stupid TV!  Bender! You're blind \n",
      "stinking sober!\n",
      "Don't do it!\n",
      "Cutting Leela's head off won't solve \n",
      "anything!\n",
      "Hey, yeah! That sounds good. Can I give \n",
      "you a hand?\n",
      "But it's a useless antenna. It's not \n",
      "like he's a ham radio or something.\n",
      "Hey, it works! The static's gone.\n",
      "She's right.\n",
      "Apology accepted. After all, you're \n",
      "only human.\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "Aww, this isn't right. Listen, Bender, \n",
      "if we found your antenna could they \n",
      "still reattach it?\n",
      "It's good to be home.\n",
      "So that's where those skin flakes went. \n",
      "Hmm, do you think this fruit tree's \n",
      "going to get enough light?\n",
      "This is huge! Bender, why don't I just \n",
      "live in here?\n",
      "\n",
      "What was wrong with your date last night?\n",
      "Yeah. If you rule out every guy with \n",
      "a lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an \n",
      "explosive violent temper, of course \n",
      "you're gonna be lonely.\n",
      "Why's everyone wearing those rings?\n",
      "I think they look cool.\n",
      "No way! We've got so much in common.\n",
      "Uh, yeah! That rings a bell.\n",
      "Psst, I need the apartment tonight. \n",
      "Go see a saucy puppet show.\n",
      "A delivery?\n",
      "I bet you Leela's holding out for a \n",
      "nice guy with one eye.\n",
      "Yeah, that'd be a timesaver.\n",
      "Wow! The Zapp Brannigan?\n",
      "Who's the Zapp Brannigan?\n",
      "Wow!\n",
      " Leela's got a boyfriend!\n",
      "I heard that one time you single-handedly \n",

      "in the something something system.\n",
      "Wow! I never would have thought of that!\n",
      "What just happened?\n",
      "Dang! Can I get this wrapped up?\n",
      "We can definitely escape, Bender. All \n",
      "you have to do is bend the hatch off \n",
      "this steam pipe.\n",
      "No good! It's full of steam!\n",
      "You wanna try escaping again?\n",
      "Man, Leela's been gone a long time. \n",
      "I hope she's at least making progress \n",
      "with Zapp Brannigan.\n",
      "Really? Why?\n",
      "What does that mean?\n",
      "Yeah, a barbecue! I'll wear my hilarious \n",
      "apron.\n",
      "Where'd they all go?\n",
      "I can't believe we flew halfway across \n",
      "the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just \n",
      "to get lunch for that stupid animal!\n",
      "The planet's kerploding!\n",
      "Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby.\n",
      "What? What are you talking about?\n",
      "How could you, Leela? I thought you \n",
      "had some standards. I mean, jeez, he's \n",
      "a dumb, gross gorilla!\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Wow, way to tell that guy off. Now what's \n",
      "your secret escape plan?\n",
      "Pew!\n",
      "We're heroes!\n",
      "\n",
      "It really puts things in perspective. \n",
      "I mean, from up here an entire world \n",
      "can seem utterly insignificant.\n",
      "I don't get this. Is blernsball exactly \n",
      "the same as baseball?\n",
      "Boring? Baseball wasn't -- hmm, so they \n",
      "finally jazzed it up?\n",
      "Home run! Ha ha! Yay! Right?\n",
      "What just happened? Why is the ball \n",
      "on that springy thing?\n",
      "Mmm, at least hotdogs haven't changed.\n",
      "Me!\n",
      "Hey, I'm starting to get the hang of \n",
      "this game. The blerns are loaded, the \n",

      "and the infield blern rule is in effect, \n",
      "right?\n",

      "all kinds of robots down there.\n",
      "11?\n",
      "What's wrong?\n",
      "Well, aren't they?\n",
      "Why is that great news?\n",
      "Really? Which one?\n",
      "Man, that one was a blast!\n",
      "So let me get this straight: This planet \n",
      "is completely uninhabited?\n",
      "Oh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited \n",
      "by boxes.\n",
      "Yeah, but I guess I'd be kinda angry \n",
      "too if I had to go to some uninhabited \n",
      "planet.\n",
      "Ah, Bender must be done with the delivery.\n",
      "Oh, my God! We have to go down and rescue \n",
      "him.\n",
      "W-what are we gonna do?\n",
      " I am fully operational, \n",
      "captain.\n",

      "Man, we look stupid. We should've gotten \n",
      "store-bought costumes.\n",
      "Uh, yup! Just two robots out roboting \n",
      "it up!  Eh?\n",
      " C!   Is the puppy \n",
      "mechanical in any way?\n",
      "I can't. I have to go to the bathroom.\n",
      "Oh, right. I wonder where they smoke \n",
      "in high school.\n",
      "Uh...\n",
      "I think the leak's stopping itself. \n",
      "Wait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. \n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Wow, the 3-D's great!\n",
      "God help us!\n",
      "Umm, too much romance, not enough human \n",
      "killing.\n",
      "I'm over here.\n",
      "It's him! He's OK!\n",
      "Ahh! It's good to hear his voice!\n",
      "My God! He's become evil.  I mean eviler!\n",
      "Psst! Bender!\n",
      "We've been looking for you. Last we \n",
      "heard you were under arrest as a human \n",
      "sympathiser.\n",
      "We're rescuing you.\n",
      "Say what?\n",
      "But, Bender, we're your friends.\n",
      "That's not true.\n",
      "Bye, Bender. I'll miss you.\n",
      "Hey, wait a minute! Isn't anyone going \n",
      "to defend us?\n",
      "Call technical support.\n",
      "No!\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "You don't look very old.\n",
      "But the judge already sentenced us at \n",
      "the trial!\n",
      "Damn right!\n",
      "Stop! Take one more step and I'll breathe \n",
      "fire on you!\n",
      "So long, suckers!  Uh, hello, suckers!\n",
      "We wanted to show you that we really \n",

      "But that doesn't make it any less meaningful.\n",
      "\n",
      "I can't take it anymore! They've been \n",

      "a rest, you two!\n",
      "Uh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. \n",
      "Uh, what subject is this?\n",
      "What a nightmare!\n",
      "What a weird dream! I'll never get back \n",
      "to sleep.\n",
      "So you're telling me they broadcast \n",
      "commercials into people's dreams?\n",
      "But, how is that possible?\n",
      "That's awful. It's like brainwashing.\n",
      "Well, sure, but not in our dreams. Only \n",
      "on TV and radio. And in magazines and \n",
      "movies and at ball games and on buses \n",
      "and milk cartons and t-shirts and written \n",
      "in the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!\n",
      "Cool.  Can I try these on before I buy \n",
      "them?\n",

      "Do you take Visa?\n",
      "American Express?\n",
      "Discover card?\n",
      "No, I can't afford them. Being poor \n",

      "they advertise things not everybody \n",
      "can afford?\n",
      "Hey who's the rocker jockey?\n",
      "Hey, Bender. Sounds like you could use \n",
      "a little of that oil.\n",
      "78, 79. 79.50. Crud! We're 50 cents \n",
      "short.\n",

      "still open.\n",
      "Yeah, well, I did open the account over \n",
      "a thousand years ago. What about my \n",
      "ATM card?\n",
      "Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza \n",

      "Alright!\n",
      "Pizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab \n",

      "favourite topping, anchovies!\n",
      "Anchovies? You know? Those little headless \n",
      "fish?\n",
      "What?!\n",
      "So none of you has ever had anchovies? \n",
      "Oh, man! You don't know what you're \n",
      "missing. They were all salty and oily \n",

      "So? What do you think?\n",
      "What's wrong with it?\n",
      "Yes!\n",
      "I have an idea for a sitcom.\n",

      "things.\n",

      "I don't need them. Not when I have my \n",
      "antique videos, my bucket of fossilised \n",
      "KFC and 50 million dollars worth of \n",
      "anchovies.\n",
      "Sure! It's the price of a cheese pizza \n",
      "and a large soda back where I used to \n",

      "Sorry. But the anchovies aren't for \n",
      "sale.\n",
      "You might as well put that chequebook \n",

      "So this is Little Neptune?\n",
      "Ooh! What's this?\n",
      "Wait a minute! This says Z-Ray.\n",
      "Hmm, I can see where that would be an \n",
      "advantage. Do you take cash?\n",
      "I'm not a little kid, Leela. I grew \n",
      "up in this city. These are my people. \n",
      "What up?\n",
      "See?\n",
      "Wow! You guys sell every kind of meat \n",
      "here except human!\n",
      "Now that you mention it, I do have trouble \n",

      " Hey Bender how's dinner coming?\n",
      "Yeah, OK.\n",
      "That's the saltiest thing I've ever \n",

      "Ow!\n",

      "It could have been. But chances were \n",
      "equally good it was an Emperor.\n",
      "You might.\n",
      "I gotta go with Bender.\n",
      "Gee, you think so, Captain? I'd better \n",
      "check with my Prime Minister.\n",
      "Hey, thanks!  Wow! This got here just \n",
      "in time.\n",
      "Umm, how about that one?\n",
      "On second thought, I'll take that one.\n",
      "You don't have to beat around the bush, \n",
      "Leela, we all know who you're talking \n",
      "about...uh, me, right?\n",
      "There won't be a lot of long-winded \n",
      "speeches, will there?\n",
      "Will there be cake?\n",
      "There you go.\n",
      "Oh, yeah! Yeah, he's right!\n",
      "So?\n",
      "80,000 years?\n",
      "Damn! I knew you wouldn't have asked \n",
      "unless it was really high or really \n",
      "low.\n",
      "Well at least my assassin will get what's \n",
      "coming to him.\n",
      "Hey, I plan on having a few brewskis \n",
      "myself.\n",
      "Yeah, I was going to thumb through that \n",
      "later.\n",
      "Hell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, \n",
      "I wouldn't be Emperor. And I wouldn't \n",
      "even be here in the year 3000. It's \n",
      "just like the story of the grasshopper \n",
      "and the octopus. All year long the grasshopper \n",
      "kept burying acorns for winter while \n",
      "the octopus mooched off his girlfriend \n",
      "and watched TV. But then the winter \n",
      "came and the grasshopper died and the \n",
      "octopus ate all his acorns and also \n",

      "through to you?\n",
      "Who asked you to? I told you a hundred \n",

      "Now go. Go gather your nuts you nagging \n",
      "grasshopper.\n",

      "Ow!\n",
      "What am I gonna do?\n",
      "But won't that crush my bones?\n",
      "I could vomit or urinate. Would you \n",
      "feel better about that?\n",
      "That's a great idea! Crying.\n",
      "It's no use. I wanna cry but I'm just \n",
      "too macho.\n",

      "Phew! That's a load off my mind.\n",
      "She'll never help me. She's still mad \n",

      "This is the saddest day of my life. \n",

      "No. No!\n",
      "This can't be happening.\n",
      "All Leela ever wanted to do was help \n",

      "of her.\n",
      "Leela! You're alive!\n",
      "Thanks, Leela. From now on, I'll take \n",
      "all the help you're willing to give. \n",
      "I know you just want what's best for \n",

      "on!  That hurt!\n",
      " Oh, now I understand.\n",

      "we making out?\n",
      "Wow! We're great kissers!\n",
      "Hey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back \n",
      "in the 20th century. Ah, it's cool how \n",
      "we sort of think exactly alike, and \n",
      "junk.\n",
      "Everything was going great. Then all \n",
      "of a sudden, she's talking about hanging \n",
      "out. Hangin out? She's getting way too \n",
      "serious. I'm not a one woman man, Leela.\n",
      "Don't you get it? She's smothering me.\n",
      "You see? You see? Now she's bothering \n",
      "me when I'm at work.\n",
      "I'm doing my job -- there's Amy. I spend \n",
      "a few hours selecting a candy from the \n",

      "Amy!\n",
      "Am I?  Am I?  Face \n",
      "it, I'm a prize catch.  I mean, I'm \n",
      "pulling down delivery boy money.\n",
      "Then she wants me as a trophy husband. \n",
      "Leela, you gotta come to Europa with \n",
      "us, I can't be alone with her.\n",
      "Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics \n",
      "with just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.\n",
      "Jeez, we're already planning to spend \n",
      "Valentine's Day together. Isn't that \n",
      "enough?\n",
      "Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending \n",
      "Valentine's Day together?\n",
      "That's it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, \n",
      "you drive.\n",
      " Pardon me, excuse me.\n",
      "Amy, you know how at first you like \n",
      "chocolate but then you start to get \n",
      "tired of it because it always wants \n",
      "to hang out with you?\n",
      "Look, could chocolate just let me finish?\n",
      "Amy, what I'm trying to say is, I think \n",
      "maybe you and I should stop--\n",
      "Ow! My head is killing me. What happened? \n",
      "Was anybody hurt?\n",
      "How badly?\n",
      "Where is it?\n",
      "Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere \n",
      "with your life too much.\n",
      "Ooh, sorry. I guess I control that arm.\n",
      "Oh, that.  Maybe we'd better talk in \n",
      "private.  I'll meet you \n",
      "in the closet.\n",
      "Amy, I really like you, as a friend. \n",
      "But I think we're spending too much \n",
      "time together.\n",
      "I just think we should start seeing \n",
      "other people.\n",
      "I'm sorry, but it is.\n",
      "Huh?\n",
      "Hey, I can get a date too. Now that \n",
      "I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of \n",
      "women!\n",
      " Oh!  Oh!\n",
      "Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you \n",
      "for a minute?  In private?\n",
      "This is an emergency. Amy made Valentine's \n",
      "plans with some goon and I'm gonna be \n",
      "stuck there, lonely and miserable. Will \n",
      "you be my date, please?\n",
      "Then I have no choice but to do something \n",
      "so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm \n",
      "ashamed to tell you about it.\n",
      "Thanks.\n",
      "Why exactly did you shave your legs \n",
      "anyway? Are you expecting something \n",
      "to happen with your Valentine's date?\n",
      "And another thing: You're using an awful \n",
      "lot of make-up there.\n",
      "What does it do?\n",
      "20 minutes? You're practically ready \n",
      "now!\n",
      "Oh, God, it's true!\n",
      " Thanks.  Where is she?\n",
      "I've got a date. She'll be along any \n",
      "minute.\n",
      "Uh--\n",
      " She seems a little old \n",
      "for me.\n",
      "Oh, yeah? Well I want one too.\n",
      "But you just said--\n",
      "Well, ma'am I--\n",
      "No, but I control this arm.\n",
      "Wait, come back, uh, darling.\n",
      "Oh, jeez, get a room!\n",
      "Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out \n",
      "for ice cream.\n",
      "Nooo!  That's it I'm gettin' the hell \n",
      "outta here.  Ooh! Ow!\n",
      "Oh, Leela!\n",
      "Thank you.\n",
      "Can I live without it?\n",
      "So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And \n",
      "I hope there are no hard feelings about \n",
      "your date, or stuff.\n",
      "Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own \n",
      "body back.\n",
      "Seems to be. My neck's just a little \n",
      "tender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. \n",
      "Thanks for rescuing me last night.\n",
      "I guess so.  Watch the neck! Watch the \n",
      "neck!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nah. If I ever wanna go back to the \n",
      "year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again.\n",
      "Cool, it's just like the good old days!\n",
      "Hey Leela, get a picture of me being \n",
      "\"mugged.\"\n",
      "Yeah I asked a cop once. It means \"Up \n",
      "yours kid.\"\n",
      "Uh, sorry Bender that's just a phone \n",
      "booth.\n",
      "In New York? Bathrooms.\n",
      "I'll show you.  Whup.\n",
      "No, it's a mobile apartment with no \n",
      "rent.\n",
      "We sometimes called it a jogging suit.\n",
      "Hey, my girlfriend had one of those! \n",
      "Actually it wasn't her's it was her \n",
      "dad's. Actually she wasn't my girlfriend. \n",
      "She just lived next door and never closed \n",
      "her curtains.\n",
      "C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look.\n",
      "Hey! This is from Miller's Outpo - uh, \n",
      "I mean, yeah, I work here alright!\n",
      "Nope.  No one in New York drove. There \n",
      "was too much traffic.  Nice! Listen \n",
      "to that baby purr!\n",
      "It's just like riding a bicyc -\n",
      "I'm just glad we hit something. I thought \n",
      "we'd never stop.\n",
      "How's that robot I ran over?\n",
      "You mean he's -\n",
      "I don't get it.\n",
      "So uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your \n",
      "body like that. You OK now?\n",
      "Well just let me know if there's anything \n",
      "I can do to make it up to you.\n",
      "Uh...sure.\n",
      "How's that?\n",
      "Uh I can't get any lower than this.\n",
      "I don't like this place. It's 120 degrees \n",
      "and there's very little oxygen.\n",
      " Uh, yeah. Look at that exhaust \n",
      "fan.\n",
      "Uh, no, that's alright.  Ow! Ow!\n",
      "I'm telling you there's something about \n",
      "Flexo I don't like.\n",
      "Yeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he's \n",
      "bad news. I regret ever running him \n",
      "over.\n",
      "He's much worse. He drinks, he smokes \n",
      "and he posts naked pictures of me on \n",
      "the internet.\n",
      "I'm talking about Flexo.\n",
      "No I'm not. Mark my words. Flexo's evil. \n",
      "He's the evil Bender.\n",
      "Can I touch it?\n",
      "Uh, maybe we should stick with people \n",
      "we know and trust. I mean, Flexo's great \n",
      "but -\n",
      "Wait, I don't like the sound of that. \n",
      "Let's just go alphabetically.\n",
      "Wait, let's go by rank.\n",
      "Flexo outranks me?\n",
      "Don't point that at me.\n",
      "Look, I know Flexo's your friend but \n",
      "I don't trust him alone with the atom.\n",
      "I'm not prejudiced.\n",
      "Caught you!  I saw you looking at the \n",
      "atom!\n",
      "Oh-ho you'd like it if I went to sleep \n",
      "wouldn't you?\n",
      "Yeah well here's a funny joke. I'm gonna \n",
      "sit right here till it's my shift.\n",
      "That I will.\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Good.\n",
      "Good.  Good.\n",
      "Well, that's eight hours.\n",
      "Finally, the atom is safe.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "He must have used a sleep ray on me. \n",
      "Sleep rays exist in the future right?\n",
      "Then I must've fallen asleep.\n",
      "Aha!  Uh searching...hmm.\n",
      "I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago \n",
      "so I thought it was time to check again.\n",
      " Say Bender, can I hold \n",
      "that map for a second?\n",
      "Give it up!\n",
      "Or maybe, he never left at all!  Wait \n",
      "a minute. You're Bender.\n",
      "But why were you wearing that scarf, \n",
      "that turtleneck and this fruity number?\n",
      "100,000?\n",
      "Well, we'll be leaving now. If you'll \n",
      "just sign this form saying you received \n",
      "the atom.\n",
      "Flexo!\n",
      "Flexo! Shoot Flexo!\n",
      "Bender? You stole the atom?\n",
      "Whoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil \n",
      "Bender? I am shocked, shocked! Well \n",
      "not that shocked.\n",
      "I'm so confused. The Bender I liked \n",
      "turn out to be evil and the Bender I \n",
      "hated was good. How can I live my life \n",
      "when I can't tell good from evil?\n",
      "Well, you guys might both be losers \n",
      "but I just made out with that radiator \n",
      "woman from the radiator planet.\n",
      "Oh.  Is there a burn ward within 10 \n",
      "feet of here?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey, Hermes!\n",
      "Hermes has all the fun. Wait a second! \n",
      "He's got a Brain Slug on his head!\n",
      "Hey, yeah!\n",
      "Cool, let's see this one!\n",
      "Yeah, I wanna see that.\n",
      "I'll take a small Slurm.\n",
      "Uh, OK.  Oh, man!\n",
      " Ooh, this is real futuristic!\n",
      "No I didn't!\n",

      "Wow! Thanks, Hermes!  I-- Hey! Cut that \n",
      "out!\n",

      "It's immense.\n",
      "So I see!\n",
      "Well, thanks to the internet, I'm bored \n",
      "with sex. Is there a place on the web \n",
      "that panders to my lust for violence?\n",
      "Uh, \"video game\" you say? Well golly \n",
      "gee, you mighty spacemen of the future \n",
      "will have to show me how it works.\n",

      "Ow!\n",
      "Mmm! Great pancakes Leela!\n",
      "He may be some lowlife jerk but I don't \n",

      "No! No!\n",
      "Ohh!\n",
      "Pst, Leela. you've got to get me out \n",

      "Jeez Hermes, you seem awfully calm about \n",
      "this.\n",
      "I thought it would fit.\n",

      "Man, how long is this gonna take?\n",
      "OK.\n",

      "and then I can eat more.\n",
      "Oh Lucy! You're just like I always thought \n",
      "you'd be from your movies.\n",

      "corn I want you to know that I love \n",
      "you as much as a man can love a computerised \n",

      "That's it! This place is too dangerous. \n",
      "We've gotta get you out of here!  Everything's \n",

      "which is the safest part of nowhere. \n",
      "Just stay put and enjoy this calendar.\n",
      "Safe and sound! Finally I can continue \n",
      "to exist!\n",
      "Well, I killed my grandfather.\n",
      "I dunno. Maybe God loves me.\n",
      "Aww. There there. If it makes you feel \n",
      "any better, his body was vapourised \n",
      "so there's no chance of him coming back \n",

      "Then you're a braver woman than I.\n",
      "Uh, how far is it?\n",
      "Aww I know how you feel. My grandfather \n",
      "died recently.\n",
      "Hey, you know what always cheers you \n",
      "up? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!\n",

      "But...but won't that change history?\n",
      "Take this Mr President, sir!\n",

      "Bender!\n",
      "Bendeeeeer!\n",
      "Oh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely \n",
      "right now. Trapped a thousand years \n",
      "in the past. Hey! Wait a second!\n",
      "No.  Wait!\n",
      "He's alive!  Bender. What was it like \n",

      "wood show.\n",
      "Alright!\n",
      "These letters are real butt-nutters! \n",
      "Listen to this one:  Dear \n",
      "Santa.\n",
      "It's not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed \n",
      "to bring people together, not blow them \n",
      "apart!\n",
      "Certainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We've \n",
      "gotta bring back the kind of Xmas I \n",

      "Are you his elves?\n",
      "But you live in a gingerbread house.\n",
      "That's it! I'm gonna deliver a gift \n",

      "Faster! Faster!\n",
      "Why aren't we moving?\n",
      "He's trapped!\n",

      "Oh, no! The ice is melting!\n",
      "And your breezy short-shorts!\n",
      "Hurry! We've gotta think of another \n",
      "way to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!\n",
      "I'm Santa Claus!\n",
      "Your Mayorness, if you execute him, \n",
      "you have to execute all of us.\n",
      "This is horrible.\n",

      "Xmas isn't so rotten after all.\n",
      "But don't you see? Fear has brought \n",

      "\n",
      "Kinda gamey.\n",
      "Bender no! You'll make God cry.\n",
      "Speaking of which, try these nachos.\n",
      "Psst, we found him!\n",
      "He's dead.\n",
      "Ooo I have one. I'm good at video games \n",
      "and bad at everything else. That's why \n",
      "I wish life were more like a video game.\n",
      "Uh, What if that thing I said?\n",
      "Wait a second, I know that monkey. His \n",
      "name is Donkey.\n",
      "Well sir, I spent all of ninth grade \n",
      "studying them. Except for that day when \n",
      "my eyeballs started to bleed. And in \n",
      "my opinion.\n",
      "Hey watch out!\n",
      "Its OK, I had another guy!\n",
      "Alright, its Saturday night. I have \n",

      "It's moving too fast. Oh I could never \n",

      "What do you monsters want?\n",
      "I guess so.\n",
      "Ow!\n",

      "own horn!\n",
      "Hey, that's not a nice thing to say.\n",
      "Man, we've been skipping for hours. \n",
      "I need to pull over and take the wiz.\n",
      "That's great Leela.\n",
      "Why does everyone keep saying that?\n",

      "on the head.\n",
      "Never mind Professor, she came to.\n",
      "\n",

      "among these trillions of hearts, those \n",
      "words must already exist. And I'm gonna \n",
      "find them.\n",
      "And you got a cage for the lion!\n",
      "Before we deliver these hearts, I'm \n",
      "gonna find the one that sums up my feelings \n",
      "for you!  \"I Love You.\" Hmm, too conventional. \n",
      "\"You're My Man.\" Ooo so close!\n",
      "Whoa!\n",
      "Maybe we hit a space cow.\n",
      "Wow Bender. Are you and the ship an \n",
      "item? I mean I know you're both items \n",
      "but...how can you date a ship anyway? \n",
      "It'd be like me dating a really fat \n",
      "lady. And living inside her. And she'd \n",
      "be all like...\n",
      "The ship? But you just started dating.\n",
      "You have much to teach us.\n",
      "Planet Express Ship? Is that you?\n",
      "Uh, um no. I think he's at his parent's.\n",
      "Bender? No! He's an old fashioned one \n",
      "spaceship robot. Look I'll tell him \n",
      "you stopped by OK?\n",
      "Incoming torpedoes. Shields at maximum \n",
      "yarnell.\n",
      "You couldn't have picked a better time \n",
      "to dump the ship Bender!\n",
      "What's happening? Space cow?\n",
      "Ha! That barely hurt Leela at all!\n",
      "Same as everyday, got it.\n",
      "I'm on it. And maybe I'll find those \n",
      "magic words while I'm at it.\n",
      "Eh.  Blech!  Eurgh! Ooo how 'bout this \n",
      "one?\n",
      "Um, Leela?\n",
      "Oh nothing.\n",
      "Happy Valentine's day.\n",
      "Bender! Are you OK?\n",
      "Well I guess we'd better clean up these \n",
      "millions of hearts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sure. We talk about it all the time.\n",
      "No. Burn!\n",
      "What does it taste like?\n",
      "If those aren't tears of happiness, \n",
      "please stop crying.\n",
      "Is it this room that's making you sad? \n",
      "It's probably the room. Come on, lets \n",
      "go for a walk.\n",
      "Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.\n",
      "Then today's your lucky day because \n",
      "I happen to be a holding, stroking, \n",
      "lovin' machine! Also spankin'!\n",
      "Well, anyway, just remember that people \n",
      "care about you.\n",
      "Yo yo, Bezender! What up?\n",
      "No fair!\n",
      "It's like that time I peeked in the \n",
      "kitchen at Imperial Hunan.\n",
      "What happened?\n",
      "That's when we saved Earth from a giant \n",
      "asteroid of garbage.\n",
      " Dude! Over here!\n",
      "And also - for some reason - the letter \n",
      "I wrote you full of my personal feelings.\n",
      "Leela, freak out later. We're not done \n",
      "escaping yet!\n",
      "Ow!\n",
      " Shut up, you two! We can \n",
      "kill ourselves when we get home!\n",
      "Come on Leela. You can do it!\n",
      "Whoa! What are you doing?\n",
      "Leela's going nuts and I can't save \n",
      "her unless I learn more about her mysterious \n",
      "past. Isn't there anything else you \n",
      "can tell me?\n",
      "That's impossible because my time is \n",
      "worthless!\n",
      "Hand it over.\n",
      "Look, I'm trying to save someone here. \n",
      "I'll have to come back for those later.\n",
      "Can you translate it?\n",
      "I didn't ask for a completely reasonable \n",
      "excuse. I asked you to get busy.\n",
      "Isn't that the same machine that makes \n",
      "noses?\n",
      "Is it done?\n",
      "Stop!  Thanks Bender! Don't do it Leela!\n",
      "Close.\n",
      "I had the Professor analyse the alienese \n",
      "letter that was found with you.\n",
      "I 'unno. But the analysis showed it \n",
      "was printed on recycled toilet paper. \n",
      "A squeezably soft paper used mainly \n",
      "in the sewers.\n",
      "\n",
      "So what's Mars Day about, anyway?\n",
      "Lighten up, Leela. It's funny!\n",
      "I'll have a thorax and some feelers.\n",
      "Yuck!\n",
      "What's that weird sound?\n",
      "Aw, man!\n",
      "Yee-haw!\n",
      "Where?\n",
      "Oh. Oh!\n",
      "Where?\n",
      "Pfft, that's not scary!\n",
      "Hook on the hand!\n",
      "Man in the attic!\n",
      "With pleasure.  Once, not \n",
      "far from here, four people set out on \n",
      "a cattle drive--\n",
      "And then, while they sat helplessly \n",
      "around the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding \n",
      "escaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant \n",
      "snuck up and--\n",
      "Hey, it's that \"barbecue's over\" sound \n",
      "again.\n",
      "Where?\n",
      "My God!\n",
      "Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly.\n",
      "Hm.\n",
      "Yeah!\n",
      "Wait. That's the bead you traded your \n",
      "land for?\n",
      "\n",
      "Hey! Now what am I supposed to watch \n",
      "and drink all day?\n",
      "Well there's the material rewards.\n",
      "Happy funeral Bender!\n",
      "We just wanted to show you that you \n",
      "really will be remembered.\n",
      "Dearly beloved, we are here today to \n",
      "remember Bender, taken from us in the \n",
      "prime of life, when he was crushed by \n",
      "a runaway semi, driven by the Incredible \n",
      "Hulk.\n",
      "Now let us each remember the best things \n",
      "about Bender in our own way. Professor?\n",
      "Yes there is Bender. Bender was a lot \n",
      "of things to a lot of people, but looking \n",
      "back, the number one thing I can say \n",
      "about him is this, and simply this: \n",
      "Bender was my friend.\n",
      "I thought something looked different \n",
      "in here.\n",
      "Hi, we have a giant stone to deliver \n",
      "- sign here.\n",
      "Call it a hunch but, I've got a bad \n",
      "feeling about this.\n",
      "You know the worst thing about being \n",
      "a slave? They make you work but they \n",
      "don't pay you or let you go.\n",
      "Incredible. This place is just like \n",
      "the Ancient Egypt of my day.\n",
      "I knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular \n",
      "theories: a billion!\n",
      "Also Wolfman!\n",
      "Yeah, remember who your real friends \n",
      "are.\n",
      "Can you believe it? Pharaoh's dead!\n",
      "I'm gonna spin til I fall down!\n",
      "You know what else stinks about being \n",
      "a slave? The hours.\n",
      "Hey, I think I know who the next Pharaoh \n",
      "is!\n",
      "Bender, I really hope that's you. 'Cause \n",
      "if it isn't......we're in trouble!\n",
      "What proof is this? Some huge number?\n",
      "Bend-er? Doesn't ring a bell.  Did you \n",
      "hear something Leela?\n",
      "Hey Leela you know who I remember...?\n",
      "...That guy who used to bend things. \n",
      "You know...?\n",
      "...Hermes.\n",
      "Absolutely.\n",
      "\n",
      "Space pirates?\n",
      "Come on, come on.\n",
      "Firing torpedo number three!\n",
      "Go after him Leela!\n",
      "You mean we can never catch up to him? \n",
      "Not even if we rub the engine with cheetah \n",
      "blood?\n",
      " He always wanted to drift forever. \n",
      "But through the American Southwest.\n",
      "Can you find him Professor?\n",
      "No that's I don't -\n",
      "Well, I guess that sounds OK.\n",
      "What? Really?\n",
      "He decided not to let go.  I can't believe \n",
      "you're gone. I won't! If I can't reach \n",
      "you physically, I'll just have to try \n",
      "something desperately crazy!\n",
      "So that's my story Father Changstein \n",
      "el Gamahl. Is there anything religion \n",
      "can do to help me find my friend?\n",
      "Uh-huh but is there anything useful \n",
      "we can do?\n",
      "Bonder? Is it really you?\n",
      "Wait a minute. Bender's name isn't Bonder, \n",
      "it's Bender. You're a fraud!\n",
      "Only if you don't have any real hope.\n",
      "I've not heard of them.\n",
      "You think they'd let me use it to look \n",
      "for Bender?\n",
      "Sir, I'm outfitting an expedition to \n",
      "a monestary high in the Himalayas. I'll \n",
      "need a long sleeved coat.\n",
      "You can't give up hope just because \n",
      "it's hopeless. You gotta hope even more \n",
      "and cover your ears and go \"blah blah \n",
      "blah blah blah blah blah!\"   \n",
      "I'd also like a pack mule.\n",
      "OK.\n",
      "And then what?\n",
      "Hmm, finding God, that - that's important, \n",
      "yeah. But you know what might be a treat \n",
      "for everyone? If you let me use the \n",
      "telescope to find my lost friend Bender.\n",
      "Aw c'mon, you guys have forever to look \n",
      "for God. All I'm asking is one measley \n",
      "lifetime to find my friend.\n",
      "That telescope is as much mine as it \n",
      "is anybody's. I'm using it whether you \n",
      "give me permission or not.\n",
      "Bender? Bender?\n",
      "Hello? Has anyone out there seen Bender?\n",
      " You're right. I'm never gonna \n",
      "see him again. I know he was evil and \n",
      "on more than one occasion he, he actually \n",
      "stole my blood.  But still, I wish I \n",
      "had Bender back.\n",
      "Bender! It's a miracle!  Ow!\n",
      "We climbed a mountain and locked up \n",
      "some monks.\n",
      "Do we have to? I mean they're monks. \n",
      "I'm sure their God will let them out \n",
      "or at least give them more shoes to \n",
      "eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ooo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom \n",
