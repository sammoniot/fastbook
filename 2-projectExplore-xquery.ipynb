That\\'s exactly the job I\\'ve \\nalways wanted!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sorry, Bender, but there\\'s just \\nnot enough room.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll come visit sometime. And you can \\nvisit me here.\\n\\n\\nOh, stupid TV!  Bender! You\\'re blind \\nstinking sober!\\n\\n\\nThis is huge! Bender, why don\\'t I just \\nlive in here?\\n\\n\\nOh, right. I wonder where they smoke \\nin high school.\\n\\n\\nHey, wait a minute! Isn\\'t anyone going \\nto defend us?\\n\\n\\nReligon? Is this another scam to get \\nfree yarmulkes?\\n\\n\\nOoh ... I know this ... whatyya call \\nit? Lite Brite!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s OK, Leela, go ahead. I got a lot \\nof work to do.\\n\\n\\nAlright, scumwads. This one\\'s for Bender\\'s \\ncocktail!\\n\\n\\nMy God. What if the secret ingredient \\n... is people?\\n\\n\\nOK, you\\'re on a date. What\\'s the first \\nthing you do?\\n\\n\\nHey, I have an idea: Let\\'s all go out \\nfor ice cream.\\n\\n\\nOh-ho you\\'d like it if I went to sleep \\nwouldn\\'t you?\\n\\n\\nSo what were they doing to you in that \\nawful drawer?\\n\\n\\nWhoa, whoa! Slow down. You\\'re going \\na mile a minute.\\n\\n\\nNah. I read in Newsweek that she drinks \\nhuman blood.\\n\\n\\nLeela, freak out later. We\\'re not done \\nescaping yet!\\n\\n\\nOoo, a bot-mitzvah. Shalom hunger, shalom \\nfree food!\\n\\n\\nUh Ms Johnson? Please bring in some \\nmore chair fuel.\\n\\n\\nThen I am the most important person \\nin the universe.\\n\\n\\nYeah, they get around! But I\\'m afraid \\nwe had a deal.\\n\\n\\nOh. Kinda like how a warehouse is inhabited \\nby boxes.\\n\\n\\n$30? I can\\'t afford that. Unless... \\nDo you take Visa?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m from the 20th century. Go ahead, \\nask me anything.\\n\\n\\nAnd no one will have to punish anyone \\nfor the mutiny.\\n\\n\\nAh, I can\\'t stand to see a robot cry. \\nLet\\'s watch TV!\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it, Amy, we have to talk. Zoidberg, \\nyou drive.\\n\\n\\nHmm, you got any sacred artwork of her \\nfrom the back?\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe you\\'re really real. \\nI like your tail.\\n\\n\\nSorry, Zoidberg. I\\'m trying to join \\nthe country club.\\n\\n\\nWell, we can live without machines. \\nI was in Webelos.\\n\\n\\nLeela? What are you guys doing here \\nin the year 4000?\\n\\n\\nThen where are we? You said you knew \\nhow to navigate.\\n\\n\\nY\\'know that dance wasn\\'t as safe as \\nthey said it was.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m on it. But if you need me you know \\nwhere I\\'ll be.\\n\\n\\nC\\'mon! Lets go tell Leela so we can \\ngrow up together!\\n\\n\\nHello? Pizza delivery for uh...I. C. \\nWiener? Aw crud!\\n\\n\\nLook out!  You want her you\\'ll have \\nto go through me.\\n\\n\\nWhy and I sticky and naked? Did I miss \\nsomething fun?\\n\\n\\nOh, Bender. You didn\\'t touch the Crushinator, \\ndid you?\\n\\n\\nReally? That\\'d be great! You sure I \\nwon\\'t be imposing?\\n\\n\\nStop! Take one more step and I\\'ll breathe \\nfire on you!\\n\\n\\nWell it\\'s not my fault either \\'cause \\nI forgot to vote.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve got to do something to show Leela \\nhow sorry I am.\\n\\n\\nGoodbye, Leela.  Hey, look: We\\'re under \\nthe mistletoe.\\n\\n You just wanna talk, it \\nhas nothing to do with mating.\\n\\n\\nSo this is where they stick old people. \\nIt\\'s horrific.\\n\\n\\nUnless you let us live. Then you\\'ll \\nget off scot free.\\n\\n\\nYou believe me about the monsters, right, \\nMr. Panucci?\\n\\n\\nI woke you up early so we could hang \\nout and do stuff.\\n\\n\\nWhat are you doing? You totally ripped \\noff my routine.\\n\\n\\nAww I know how you feel. My grandfather \\ndied recently.\\n\\n\\nUh, look, we\\'ve got mail for Santa. \\nAre you his elves?\\n\\n\\nWait a second, I know that monkey. His \\nname is Donkey.\\n\\n\\n...friendship, then I\\'ll sell Planet \\nExpress, for you.\\n\\n\\nLeela, you beaned a run-in. You\\'d better \\nlet me pitch.\\n\\n\\nThis is wrong. We shouldn\\'t have abandoned \\nthem there.\\n\\n\\nBut in this case I just don\\'t think \\nit\\'ll do any good.\\n\\n\\nHey, that\\'s my old bank. Maybe my account\\'s \\nstill open.\\n\\n\\nWait. You\\'re Pamela Anderson! Cool! \\nWhat can I get you?\\n\\n\\nAh, no one likes them at first but they\\'ll \\ngrow on you.\\n\\n\\nThen we\\'re dead meat. No one could squeeze \\nunder there!\\n\\n\\nPizza delivery! Wow, so this is a real \\nTV station, huh?\\n\\n\\nProfessor, when did you become so obsessed \\nwith voting?\\n\\n\\nNow here\\'s a party I can get excited \\nabout. Sign me up!\\n\\n\\nThey\\'re supposed to be some kinda, you \\nknow, pine tree.\\n\\n\\nWhat about me? Can I come back at severely \\nreduced pay?\\n\\n\\nUm, I have a question. What if Bender \\nwas really giant?\\n\\n\\nSorry, but if it\\'s not here in half \\nan hour, it\\'s free.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m about to.  Leela, let me play for \\nyou one for time.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m Philip J. Fry! He stole my name \\nafter I got frozen.\\n\\n\\nIf those aren\\'t tears of happiness, \\nplease stop crying.\\n\\n\\nWell, anyway, just remember that people \\ncare about you.\\n\\n\\nHey! Now what am I supposed to watch \\nand drink all day?\\n\\n\\nCall it a hunch but, I\\'ve got a bad \\nfeeling about this.\\n\\n\\n...So I ask you, as a friend, won\\'t \\nyou stop this deal?\\n\\n\\nAnd here he is trying to make a catch \\nwith an oven mit.\\n\\n\\nWhat? I\\'ve seen you get up off your \\nback tons of times.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s awful Professor. Especially the \\nmaking out part.\\n\\n\\nWhich means...we can clone it! Seymour \\nwill live again!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m gonna get my puppy back! In your \\nface, Grim Reaper!\\n\\n\\nZoidberg, how could you? I used to think \\nyou were cool.\\n\\n\\nWait, I\\'m trying. It weighs as much \\nas a thousand suns!\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s just dump it in the sewer and \\nsay we delivered it.\\n\\n\\nWell I\\'m feelin\\' lucky!  Uh... I\\'m ready \\nto go back now.\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t take it anymore! They\\'ve been \\nat it for hours!  \\n\\n\\nWow! You guys sell every kind of meat \\nhere except human!\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t mean to. He just looked so \\ncool and refreshing.\\n\\n\\nWell at least my assassin will get what\\'s \\ncoming to him.\\n\\n\\nCome on Leela, step your big boot down \\non the gas pedal.\\n\\n\\nHoly camolies! The house I grew up in! \\nIt\\'s still there!\\n\\n\\nNo, I\\'m not! Oh, wait, I am. But my \\npoint remains valid!\\n\\n\\nProfessor, you\\'re a Professor. You must \\nhave some ideas.\\n\\n\\nThis is great Professor! We should go \\nout and celebrate!\\n\\n\\nYou are? So things aren\\'t working out \\nwith whatshisname?\\n\\n\\nYeah yeah yeah keep it comin\\' put the \\npot down get away!\\n\\n\\nAt last! At last I have the power to \\nmake Leela love me.\\n\\n\\nPizza dinner on me!  Just keep the tab \\nunder $50 million.\\n\\n\\nThere won\\'t be a lot of long-winded \\nspeeches, will there?\\n\\n\\nBender? No way!  I definitely would\\'ve \\nnoticed something.\\n\\n\\nOutlaw Slurm?  Uh, don\\'t pay any attention \\nto him sir ...\\n\\n\\nAnd that\\'ll allow Bender to feel other \\npeople\\'s emotions?\\n\\n\\nAh, some good old high-gravity rain. \\nThat\\'ll cool us off.\\n\\n\\nWell, I sort of a have a thing for this \\ngirl I work with.\\n\\n\\nYes! Footprints! And hand prints?  But? \\nWhat\\'s happening?\\n\\n\\nWell, at least I learned Leela\\'s a lost \\ncause. I give up.\\n\\n\\nRelax! She can\\'t be my grandmother! \\nI figured it all out.\\n\\n\\nThese letters are real butt-nutters! \\nListen to this one: \\n\\n Shut up, you two! We can \\nkill ourselves when we get home!\\n\\n\\nYou know what else stinks about being \\na slave? The hours.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t you worry about \"blank\" let me \\nworry about \"blank.\"\\n\\n\\nSo will Seymour remember how to sing \\nWalking On Sunshine?\\n\\n\\nDude hold up! Remember when Zapp blew \\na hole in the ship?\\n\\n\\nWhoa, thanks! If you ever need a saviour \\nagain, just ask.\\n\\n\\nWhatever\\'s in there it\\'s the only thing \\nI\\'ve ever wanted.\\n\\n\\nOver there! Look! It\\'s the moon landing \\nsite! We found it!\\n\\n\\nReally? I didn\\'t think he\\'d miss this \\napartment that much.\\n\\n\\nI bet you Leela\\'s holding out for a \\nnice guy with one eye.\\n\\n\\nWhat just happened? Why is the ball \\non that springy thing?\\n\\n\\nThis is the saddest day of my life. \\nAnd I still can\\'t cry.\\n\\n\\nYeah. I\\'m never going to another planet \\ncalled Cannibalon!\\n\\n\\nIt was just a dream, Bender. There\\'s \\nno such thing as two.\\n\\n\\nYou see? You see? Now she\\'s bothering \\nme when I\\'m at work.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m just glad we hit something. I thought \\nwe\\'d never stop.\\n\\n\\nNo. In fact, it looks so nice I think \\nI might get one too.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m bored. You\\'re boring, Zoidberg. \\nI\\'m gonna go watch TV.\\n\\n\\nOh, wait, it hasn\\'t started yet.  OK, \\nit\\'s about to start.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re right. Let\\'s do this now and \\nlet\\'s never regret it.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know. But it might have something \\nto do with this.\\n\\n\\nBender, I can\\'t take much more of this! \\nI want outta here!\\n\\n\\nLook. I\\'ve been studying how to pilot \\nthe ship. Impressed?\\n\\n\\nWell, so what if I love a robot? It\\'s \\nnot hurting anybody.\\n\\n\\nSo what\\'s the deal? You guys don\\'t believe \\nin Robot Jesus?\\n\\n\\nBoneitis? Pft! That\\'s a funny name for \\na horrible disease.\\n\\n\\nOh my God! It\\'s out of ice! Like some \\nouter space Motel 6!\\n\\n\\nI know, I was deliberately describing \\na similar situation.\\n\\n\\nNow if you\\'ll excuse me I\\'m working \\non Seymour\\'s doghouse.\\n\\n\\nWhere are we ever going to find a lawyer \\nto take his case?\\n\\n\\nPlus the cream won\\'t give you superpowers, \\nyou\\'re a robot.\\n\\n\\nI, I don\\'t understand. You made me go \\nin the freezer tube?\\n\\n\\nLarger than an American sedan?  How \\nbig is the honey comb?\\n\\n\\nOh, can\\'t you leave me alone? I\\'m miserable \\nenough already.\\n\\n\\nThis is stupid. I\\'m taking this thing \\nout to the real moon.\\n\\n\\nSheesh! 40,000 channels and only 150 \\nhave anything good on.\\n\\n\\nI could vomit or urinate. Would you \\nfeel better about that?\\n\\n\\nHey uh Bender. What are we doing in \\nthis bad neighbourhood?\\n\\n\\nNow these monkeys I like!  What\\'s that? \\nYou wanna come out?\\n\\n\\n50 bucks?! Not even if she was my girlfriend. \\nYou take her.\\n\\n\\nXmas, huh?  Y\\'know this\\'ll be my first \\nXmas away from home.\\n\\n\\nNo, I need to get her a gift. And I \\nneed it before sundown.\\n\\n\\nPlease let us live! We\\'ll put out milk \\nand cookies for you!\\n\\n\\nNo. Make up some feelings and tell her \\nyou have them.  Yes?\\n\\n\\nOw! My head is killing me. What happened? \\nWas anybody hurt?\\n\\n\\nNooo!  That\\'s it I\\'m gettin\\' the hell \\noutta here.  Ooh! Ow!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m telling you there\\'s something about \\nFlexo I don\\'t like.\\n\\n\\nHey, Bender. Here\\'s an exhibit about \\nMom\\'s favourite robot.\\n\\n\\nI once had a best friend who liked to \\nsmell things with me.\\n\\n\\nI believe you\\'re forgetting about our \\n5% military discount.\\n\\n\\nApartment 1I. The old me would have \\nmade a joke about that!\\n\\n\\nWhen I\\'m with you, everyday seems like \\ndouble-soup Tuesday.\\n\\n\\nThe car dealer? Wow! I guess his prices \\nreally were insane.\\n\\n\\nHmm. Maybe this is the moment to show \\nher my real surprise.\\n\\n\\nThese new hands are great. I\\'m gonna \\nbreak them in tonight.\\n\\n\\nAnd I can deliver them. Billions and \\nbillions in one night.\\n\\n\\nWell I guess we\\'d better clean up these \\nmillions of hearts.\\n\\n\\nAmazing! That\\'s why they call you \"Bender \\nThe Magnificent\"!\\n\\n\\n15? You mean he lived for 12 more years \\nafter I got frozen?\\n\\n\\nNow me and Leela are forming an awesome \\ncrime-fighting duo.\\n\\n\\nWait! I\\'m usually the first guy to toot \\nmy own lower horn -\\n\\n\\nPft. What kind of bozos would start \\na Bender protest group?\\n\\n\\nHey, Bender. Sounds like you could use \\na little of that oil.\\n\\n\\nAnd there\\'s Hookerbot 5000. She\\'s got \\na heart of solid gold!\\n\\n\\nPlease, Mr. Nixon. We\\'re appealing to \\nyour sense of decency.\\n\\n\\nUh wait, Bender\\'s my rooommate. He could \\nbe back any second.\\n\\n\\nGreat, great. The one time I forgot \\nto buy flight insurance.\\n\\n\\nMichelle, I don\\'t regret this. But I \\nboth rue and lament it.\\n\\n\\nAnd remember when Mayor Giuliani cracked \\ndown on jaywalking?\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s when we saved Earth from a giant \\nasteroid of garbage.\\n\\n\\nBend-er? Doesn\\'t ring a bell.  Did you \\nhear something Leela?\\n\\n\\nBrunch. Right. I\\'d better warn - tell \\n- warntell the others!\\n\\n\\nUh, with you blocking the only escape \\nroute? Don\\'t be silly!\\n\\n\\nUh, jeez, don\\'t get upset. I mean, OK \\nI outwitted you, but--\\n\\n\\nTremble? I laugh. Nobody knows more \\nabout Star Trek than me!\\n\\n\\nThis is where I brought my girlfriend \\non our very first date.\\n\\n\\nSo you flip out and start acting like \\nsome crazy folk singer?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know. Do refrigerators still \\ncome in cardboard boxes?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s tempting, but, well, I am already \\nkinda settled in here.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t get this. Is blernsball exactly \\nthe same as baseball?\\n\\n\\nBoring? Baseball wasn\\'t -- hmm, so they \\nfinally jazzed it up?\\n\\n\\nCool! Can I borrow the new ones? And \\na couple of blank tapes?\\n\\n\\nOh, yeah?  Read it and weep. I\\'m a certified \\ncollege dropout.\\n\\n\\nWow\" The jungles on Mars look just like \\nthe jungles on Earth.\\n\\n\\nW-Wouldn\\'t it make more sense to send \\nthe robots in first a--\\n\\n\\nBut she\\'ll crush you like a worm ... \\ncrushing a smaller worm.\\n\\n\\nOK, OK, nevermind. I\\'ll just ask those \\npeople for directions.\\n\\n\\nYeah, well, you shouldn\\'t have been \\nsuch a mean captain then.\\n\\n\\nThis is crazy, Bender. How are you gonna \\nlive without a body?\\n\\n\\nI recognise you. Didn\\'t you used to \\nhave a body of some sort?\\n\\n\\nWell, Amy, I\\'ll try not to interfere \\nwith your life too much.\\n\\n\\nBender? How did the fight go? I heard \\nsomebody got flattened!\\n\\n\\nBut there\\'s probably some cool forbidden \\nstuff you can steal.\\n\\n Ocean madness, yeah right. \\nIt\\'s always something, ain\\'t it?  \\n\\n \\nIt\\'s her! Bender, wake up! She\\'s here! \\nWake up!  Oh! oxygen!\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s something. It looks like a ditch \\nfull of fried shrimp.\\n\\n\\nI got her champagne, I opened it. What \\ndoes a guy have to do?\\n\\n\\nI knew it! Insane theories: one! Regular \\ntheories: a billion!\\n\\n\\nHey look! The player\\'s who broke the \\nvarious colour barriers!\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t drink that! The metal shavings \\nmake my throat bloody.\\n\\n\\nProfessy\\'s back!  Eww, you smell like \\nsmoking.  And drinking.\\n\\n\\nHey wait, this brain knows everything \\nabout everything right?\\n\\n\\nC\\'mon Leela, what\\'s the real reason \\nyou won\\'t go out with me?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sorry. I was up really late poking \\nthrough people\\'s desks.\\n\\n\\nHey, when you look this good, you don\\'t \\nhave to know anything.\\n\\n\\nIt looked good but I just don\\'t feel \\nlike eating. You want it?\\n\\n\\nCool! Y\\'know, I\\'ve never even seen a \\nrobot\\'s apartment before.\\n\\n\\nAnyway, I\\'m sure it\\'ll work out. This \\nway we\\'ll both be happy.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be fine. It\\'s not like anyone\\'s \\ngonna drink me.  Quit it!\\n\\n\\nYou were mean and you yelled and you \\nmade us do all that work.\\n\\n\\nAnd another thing: You\\'re using an awful \\nlot of make-up there.\\n\\n\\nNo I\\'m not. Mark my words. Flexo\\'s evil. \\nHe\\'s the evil Bender.\\n\\n\\nOr maybe, he never left at all!  Wait \\na minute. You\\'re Bender.\\n\\n\\nUh wait, this is the other Fry\\'s locker. \\nI\\'m Phry with a \"Ph.\"\\n\\n\\nWell, it turns out I loved her, but \\nI wasn\\'t in love with her.\\n\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s really long. But what did \\nyou just turn on with it?\\n\\n\\nBender, wake up!  He\\'s OK! Quick, does \\nanyone have any liquor?\\n\\n\\nBut everyone is driving around in cars \\nshooting at each other.\\n\\n\\nFar out! So, there\\'s an infinite number \\nof parallel universes?\\n\\n\\nHey, which crazy thing happening are \\nyou guys screaming about?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s like that time I peeked in the \\nkitchen at Imperial Hunan.\\n\\n\\nWe just wanted to show you that you \\nreally will be remembered.\\n\\n\\nMs Johnson, you\\'ve never lied to me. \\nAm I still a good person?\\n\\n\\nIt is? Yahoo! We\\'re poor no matter what \\nI do! The deal is off!\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t be gone long Seymour. Just wait \\nhere \\'til I come back.\\n\\n\\nLeela! Stop bonding and lets go! I got \\njelly in my underpants!\\n\\n\\'S PHOTO\\nYou can! The Leela I know doesn\\'t give \\nup this easily.\\n\\n\\nOh great space king. I humbly beg you \\nto return my human horn.\\n\\n\\nPsst, I need the apartment tonight. \\nGo see a saucy puppet show.\\n\\n\\nMan, we look stupid. We should\\'ve gotten \\nstore-bought costumes.\\n\\n\\nI tell you, being here really takes \\nme back to my college days.\\n\\n\\nWell, whatever it is, it\\'s even better \\nfresh.  Mmm, still warm.\\n\\n\\nThis snow is beautiful. I\\'m glad global \\nwarming never happened.\\n\\n\\nI care! I care plenty! I just don\\'t \\nknow how to make them stop!\\n\\n\\nOh, so all of a sudden we\\'re spending \\nValentine\\'s Day together?\\n\\n\\nC\\'mon Leela you deserve better than \\nthis guy! Dump him already!\\n\\n\\nJamaican? I thought you were some kinda \\nouter space potato man.\\n\\n\\nThis contest is as good as over. I once \\ncaught a fish this big.\\n\\n\\nBut we\\'re about to take off. We gotta \\neat our blastoff sundaes.\\n\\n\\nWell, we destroyed the toy spaceship. \\nNow what are we gonna do?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think so.  Sir, I believe you \\nowe this lady an apology.\\n\\n\\nLeela, I had worms. I needed to know \\nwho you loved. Me or them.\\n\\n\\nKareem\\'s got the skyhook but Philip \\nJ. Fry\\'s got the spacehook!\\n\\n\\nYes, I am. I simply haven\\'t discovered \\nmy primary function yet.\\n\\n Alcohol fuels my power cells. \\nAnd as a mighty robot, I--  Beep.\\n\\n\\nYou couldn\\'t have picked a better time \\nto dump the ship Bender!\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t you worry about Planet Express. \\nLet me worry about blank!\\n\\n\\nLets go check it out. You can see how \\nI lived before I met you.\\n\\n\\nSo do I get Seymour back? Are you caving \\nto political pressure?\\n\\n\\nSo I really am important? How I feel \\nwhen I\\'m drunk is correct?\\n\\n\\nOh yeah?  Could a dream take you dancing \\nin an illusion garden?\\n\\n\\nMy God! She\\'s gone. Everyone I ever \\nknew or cared about is gone.\\n\\n\\nThis is great! I haven\\'t had time off \\nsince I was 21 through 24.\\n\\n\\nNo wonder you\\'ve been staying at the \\nback of conga lines lately.\\n\\n\\nOh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you \\nfor a minute?  In private?\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s weird. It\\'s another Cyclops, \\nonly this one has five eyes.\\n\\n\\nFix it fix it fix it fix it fix it fix \\nit! Fix it fix it fix it!\\n\\n Yes! He chose me! He\\'s trying \\nto kill me! Leela, I\\'m so happy!  \\n\\n\\nI did it!  And it\\'s all thanks to the \\nbooks at my local library.\\n\\n Affirmative. I feel \\nnothing. I am a robot. Beep, beep, beep \\n...\\n\\n C\\'mon, Bender. If you\\'re \\ndone scamming Beck, we\\'re heading home.\\n\\n\\nIncredible. This place is just like \\nthe Ancient Egypt of my day.\\n\\n\\nHey, uh, what\\'s with all the pots and \\npans? You building a wife?\\n\\n\\nWait! If they mean that much to you, \\nwhy do you wanna kill them?\\n\\n\\nThose Swedes sure know how to put in \\nalmost everything you need.\\n\\n\\nTangled up Christmas lights! We can \\ntake shifts untangling them!\\n\\n Alright. I give up. I guess \\nI\\'ll just go home and marry a skunk.\\n\\n\\nBut have they seen your...y\\'know...physique, \\nsince the old days?\\n\\n\\nC\\'mon Bender let\\'s go. This chick flick \\nis getting me all barfy.\\n\\n\\nLook, Leela, I\\'m sorry. I never should \\nhave dragged you out here.\\n\\n\\nUh, excuse me? I missed a few lectures. \\nUh, what subject is this?\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t worry, Professor, it\\'s no competition \\nfor your death clock.\\n\\n\\nBut this is HDTV. It\\'s got better resolution \\nthan the real world!\\n\\n\\nAh, just like my dad used to make ... \\nuntil McDonald\\'s fired him.\\n\\n\\nAh, I just wish Slurms MacKenzie were \\nhere to enjoy this with me.\\n\\n\\nHey, aren\\'t you supposed to be eating \\nour brains? You\\'re mutants.\\n\\n\\nHey! I can get any girl I want anytime \\nI want. I\\'m just too busy.\\n\\n\\nIs that anything like a cemetary \\'cause \\nI gotta take a leak.  Ow!\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t care. I\\'m staying. I\\'ve got \\neverything I want right here.\\n\\n\\nLeela! That\\'s the second billboard you\\'ve \\ncrashed into this week!\\n\\n\\nHey, Project Satan! Over here! I\\'m \\na blind pedestrian. 20 points!\\n\\n\\nYeah! I don\\'t know why but my life really \\nturned around that day!\\n\\n\\nThat doesn\\'t look like an \"L\" at all. \\nUnless you count lowercase.\\n\\n\\nAlright, she\\'s all restocked with emergency \\njam. Let\\'s get going.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t belong here, Bender. This is \\nan asylum for insane robots!\\n\\n Because when we\\'re together \\nin here, baby, time will stand still.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m on it. And maybe I\\'ll find those \\nmagic words while I\\'m at it.\\n\\n Once, not \\nfar from here, four people set out on \\na cattle drive--\\n\\n Strike him out Leela! Do \\nit for the hundreds of women everywhere!\\n\\n\\nCan you believe it Bender? I\\'m going \\nto have my best friend back!\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s just forget about the box. The \\nProfessor said to stay away.\\n\\n\\nYay my buddy\\'s home! And his respect \\nfor women is back to normal.\\n\\n\\nIts my old neighbourhood. Man, this \\nbrings back a lot of memories.\\n\\n\\nWow, way to tell that guy off. Now what\\'s \\nyour secret escape plan?\\n\\n\\nHmm, I can see where that would be an \\nadvantage. Do you take cash?\\n\\n\\nSorry everyone but need I remind you? \\nBlood is thicker than water.\\n\\n\\nNot physically. But why don\\'t you ask \\nyour new best friend, Leela?\\n\\n\\nAlright, alright. If it\\'ll make you \\nhappy, I\\'ll overthrow society.\\n\\n\\nYou take that back! She does not look \\ngood for a truck stop chick!\\n\\n\\nNot yet commander. Yancy\\'s just trying \\nto steal my stuff as usual.\\n\\n\\nAw, you look so sad. You want me to \\nsend Patch Cord Adams back in?\\n\\n\\nOoh, ooh, ooh, put me in, professor. \\nI wanna show Leela my skills.\\n\\n\\nUh huh. And I guess now maybe I can \\nget to know the real Lucy Liu.\\n\\n\\nYour Mayorness, if you execute him, \\nyou have to execute all of us.\\n\\n\\nKif touched everybody there. Couldn\\'t \\nany one of us be the mother?\\n\\n\\nLeela let\\'s turn back. There\\'s absolutely \\nno shame in wussing out.\\n\\n\\nBut what if he wants to, I mean if he \\ntries to...uh...Barry White?\\n\\n\\nAnd there\\'s a robot scratching post. \\nYou should try it out Bender.\\n\\n\\nWhat are you talking about? There\\'s \\nall kinds of robots down there.\\n\\n\\nSo let me get this straight: This planet \\nis completely uninhabited?\\n\\n\\nI could if you hadn\\'t turned on the \\nlights and shut off the stereo.\\n\\n\\nNo, no, I think I\\'ll just smell around \\na bit over here!  Hmm.  Hmm.\\n\\n\\nSo this thing\\'s gonna destroy the whole \\ncity?  What the heck is it?\\n\\n\\nWhy would robots vote for Nixon now \\nthat he\\'s just a head in a jar?\\n\\n\\nOK, OK, don\\'t worry. The love meister \\nwill take you under his wing.\\n\\n\\nBoy, this A.C. is incredible!  I\\'d better \\nturn on the heater too.  \\n\\n\\nSo uh, Flexo. Sorry about crushing your \\nbody like that. You OK now?\\n\\n\\nWait, I don\\'t like the sound of that. \\nLet\\'s just go alphabetically.\\n\\n Stop! The robot\\'s not your \\nenemy! He\\'s just a poor, misunderstood--\\n\\n\\nBut the air\\'s green and there\\'s no sign \\nof civilisation whatsoever.\\n\\n\\nLeela, I\\'m through making fun of women. \\nNow I want them to help me.\\n\\n\\nMan, even the news monster is acting \\nstrange. What are we gonna do?\\n\\n\\nYes I did Leels! And I\\'ll tell you why. \\nBecause it grows the brand.\\n\\n Oh, I was confused because the \\nscoreboard says something different.\\n\\n\\nWow! Nude hot-tubbing? That\\'s all I \\nneed to hear about Freedom Day!\\n\\n\\nMy God, he\\'s gonna do it! Everybody, \\nseatbelts to maximum buckling.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll miss you Leela. I\\'ll come ack and \\nvisit when I\\'m all grown up.\\n\\n\\nNope, I\\'m better than ever. Before the \\naccident I couldn\\'t do this!\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll just start you off with some bread. \\nSome sexy, arousing bread!\\n\\n\\nNo not yet. How \\'bout we go look for \\nthe original moon landing site?\\n\\n\\nWe wanted to show you that we really \\ndo respect your robot heritage.\\n\\n\\nIt could have been. But chances were \\nequally good it was an Emperor.\\n\\n\\nGee, you think so, Captain? I\\'d better \\ncheck with my Prime Minister.\\n\\n\\nI thought your duty was to cast the \\ntie-breaking vote in the Senate.\\n\\n\\nI am so unlucky! I\\'ve run over black \\ncats that were luckier than me.\\n\\n\\nWell I\\'d like to see you try and steal \\nthis. the septuple head spin.\\n\\n\\nWait a second! Maybe your futuristic \\nXmas isn\\'t so rotten after all.\\n\\n\\nHey wait a second. How did you deliver \\na million papers in one hour?\\n\\n\\nListen Leela, let me make it up by taking \\nyou out to dinner tonight.\\n\\n\\nMy hands. My horrible human hands.  \\nAnd what did you do to my nails?\\n\\n\\nSo you\\'re telling me they broadcast \\ncommercials into people\\'s dreams?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m dying of thirst. Grab my feet and \\ndunk my head in so I can drink.\\n\\n\\nHey, I wonder if these guys are here \\nto watch the erotic display too.\\n\\n\\nAmy, what I\\'m trying to say is, I think \\nmaybe you and I should stop--\\n\\n\\nI\\'m so lonely since I came to the future. \\nWill you be my friend?  Ow!\\n\\n\\nMighty sir, we have nowhere to go. Could \\nwe please join your society?\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t please Leela no matter what \\nI do! I just want her to like me.\\n\\n\\nWait a minute! I know what\\'s going on \\nhere. You\\'ve all become idiots!\\n\\n\\nHe promised he\\'d give his Uncle Zoid \\na million bucks to make a movie.\\n\\n Here lies Philip J. Fry, named \\nfor his uncle, to carry on his spirit.\\n\\n\\nAt least I have friends on the outside. \\nBender\\'s been no help at all.\\n\\n\\nOh Lucy! You\\'re just like I always thought \\nyou\\'d be from your movies.\\n\\n\\nAnd all you had to put up with was one \\nreally annoying Star Trek fan.\\n\\n\\nFancy cigar why don\\'t you smoke it already? \\nPuff puff go go go go go!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s kinda cramped in here. I don\\'t \\neven have room to hang my clothes.\\n\\n\\nAh, Leela\\'s not that bad. I just wish \\nshe didn\\'t make us work so much.\\n\\n\\nWhat the hell\\'s going on? I thought \\nyou were anti-dirty not pro-dirty.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re right. Nothing is over so long \\nas there\\'s one thin ray of hope.\\n\\n\\nHey! Stephen Hawking! Aren\\'t you that \\nphysicist that invented gravity?\\n\\n He always wanted to drift forever. \\nBut through the American Southwest.\\n\\n\\nLook, Leonard, we\\'re light enough to \\nkeep the tapes! Isn\\'t that great?\\n\\n\\nThen what if we shared a sleigh ride \\nacross the ice fields of Hiperia?\\n\\n\\nWe called it first. Besides, this place \\nkinda feels like a \"B\" y\\'know?\\n\\n\\nCoffee coffee coffee coffee coffee coffee \\ncoffee coffee coffee coffee!\\n\\n\\nBigfoot! He\\'s real! I knew it. The Loch \\nNess Monster\\'s book was right!\\n\\n\\nOh, man. I had no idea. If only I knew \\nwhere he was I\\'d go talk to him.\\n\\n\\nSo I\\'m really back? That\\'s exactly what \\nI wanted, I guess. Who are you?\\n\\n\\nShe\\'ll never help me. She\\'s still mad \\nthat I told her never to help me.\\n\\n\\nWouldn\\'t a solid gold fiddle weigh hundreds \\nof pounds and sound crummy?\\n\\n\\nOh, I don\\'t know.  Hey, Professor, what \\nare you teaching this semester?\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t stop eating this delicious ooze. \\nBut I\\'m not gonna let you die.\\n\\n \\nBoy, this heater is incredible! I\\'d \\nbetter turn up the A.C. some more.\\n\\n\\nAw, relax buddy. You were probably just \\nshooting some big, fuzzy craps.\\n\\n\\nIf anyone wants to tell me what\\'s going \\non here, I\\'ll be in the lounge.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t listen to them, Leela. People \\nsaid I was dumb, but I proved them.\\n\\n\\nWell, I\\'m down to my last lottery ticket. \\nCherry.  Cherry!  Mule. Crud!\\n\\n\\nMy God! This mean the flying saucer \\nthat crashed in Roswell...was...us!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s impossible! I mean, if she\\'s my \\ngrandmother, who\\'s my grandfather?\\n\\n\\nWait a minute. Bender\\'s name isn\\'t Bonder, \\nit\\'s Bender. You\\'re a fraud!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m taking him home and I\\'d like to \\nsee anyone try and stop me.  Uh-oh!\\n\\n\\nThe address was on Dogdoo 8 but the \\nuniverse ends right after Dogdoo 7!\\n\\n\\nNo I mean the singed flesh, I can smell \\nit!  Those lilacs on the table.\\n\\n\\nWell, the doctor says I\\'m as healthy \\nas a crab. Can I go into space now?\\n\\n\\nHmm, I\\'m not sure we want to pay for \\na dimension we\\'re not going to use.\\n\\n\\nBut it\\'s a useless antenna. It\\'s not \\nlike he\\'s a ham radio or something.\\n\\n\\nThat sounds like me but, I thought I \\ngot frozen. Wasn\\'t I in the future?\\n\\n\\nWell, it took an hour to write. I thought \\nit would take an hour to read.\\n\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s like we feel the same way \\nabout junk and stuff, or, whatever.\\n\\n\\nWell just let me know if there\\'s anything \\nI can do to make it up to you.\\n\\n\\nPeople, I won\\'t let you enter. Popplers \\nare as intelligent as you or me.\\n\\n\\nSo then my chair tilted back and I almost \\nfell into this freezer thingy.\\n\\n\\nAlright. But I need a weapon to fight \\noff drunken robots when I wake up.\\n\\n\\nTake that! And that! This sentence I \\ndon\\'t understand but take this one!\\n\\n\\n71st street? Hmm, never heard of it. \\nDowntown could be in any direction.\\n\\n\\nSo that\\'s where my clover is? Hey, is \\nthat orbitting cemetary near here?\\n\\n\\nI had the Professor analyse the alienese \\nletter that was found with you.\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s so proud of his awful cooking. \\nIf we don\\'t eat it he\\'ll be crushed.\\n\\n\\nEurgh! I can\\'t believe how fat I look! \\nAw, Nibbler\\'s there. Wait! What?!\\n\\n\\nYeah, but he might get kind of upset. \\nI don\\'t think I can do that to him.\\n\\n\\nWell, this place has everything except \\nthe only thing I care about: A TV.\\n\\n\\nCome on, it\\'ll be fun! Maybe we could \\neven drink a little fortified wine.\\n\\n\\nI guess he realised I was right when \\nI told him to go back to the jungle.\\n\\n\\nSo, is it true that alligators flushed \\ndown the toilet survive down here?\\n\\n\\nLeela! Oh, my God! You saved my life. \\nI am gonna get you so many lizards.\\n\\n\\nHey! This is from Miller\\'s Outpo - uh, \\nI mean, yeah, I work here alright!\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t like this place. It\\'s 120 degrees \\nand there\\'s very little oxygen.\\n\\n\\nHermes has all the fun. Wait a second! \\nHe\\'s got a Brain Slug on his head!\\n\\n\\nAnd if that doesn\\'t work, I got you \\na six-pack of champagne and a funnel.\\n\\n\\nThis is the best movie I\\'ve ever seen. \\nIt has a vampire and an explosion!\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s go microwave, I\\'m in a hurry here! \\nHm?  Hey, what smells like blue?\\n\\n\\nMan, we\\'ve been skipping for hours. \\nI need to pull over and take the wiz.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t ask for a completely reasonable \\nexcuse. I asked you to get busy.\\n\\n\\nWait. We could hide you! We\\'ll pile \\nfruit on you and claim you\\'re a bowl.\\n\\n\\nWell could you do it some place else? \\nI\\'m setting up Seymour\\'s doggy bed.\\n\\n\\nLeela, is the person that parrot is \\nmimicking telling the truth by proxy?\\n\\n\\nUh, greetings, Moon Man, we come in \\npeace. I am Fry from the planet Earth.\\n\\n Face \\nit, I\\'m a prize catch.  I mean, I\\'m \\npulling down delivery boy money.\\n\\n\\nHe must have used a sleep ray on me. \\nSleep rays exist in the future right?\\n\\n\\nHey! How come when I wanna do fun stuff \\nthat\\'ll kill me you\\'re against it?\\n\\n\\nI think it was just an airport. They \\nhad a place where you could buy nuts.\\n\\n\\nUh, Leela, I think there might be something \\nwrong with the coffee machine.\\n\\n\\nBut instead of falling in and getting \\nfrozen, I missed and wanged my head.\\n\\n\\nHey, now that you\\'re in the future, \\nyou can go live in an actual bio-dome!\\n\\n\\nNowadays, people aren\\'t interested in \\nart that\\'s not tattooed on fat guys.\\n\\n\\nShe does too! She\\'s loaded with meat! \\nShe\\'s got more meat than a cow!  Ow!\\n\\n\\nI hope Satan has a nice colon, \\'cause \\nthat\\'s where you\\'re gonna be living!\\n\\n\\nYes! I\\'m free!  Alright, Brain. Get \\nready for some electroshock treatment!\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re smart, you\\'re beautiful, and \\nbest of all, you\\'ll go out with me-ee?\\n\\n\\nDownload a celebrity from the internet? \\nWhat part of that do I understand?\\n\\n\\nAh! Bathtub eggnog! Just the way Grandma \\nused to drink.  Ew! It went sour!\\n\\n\\nBut don\\'t you see? Fear has brought \\nus together. That\\'s the magic of Xmas!\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause he was a loner who hated the \\npopular monsters yet longed to be one.\\n\\n\\nBender! Leela! Don\\'t leave me. Wait \\na minute! Hey, buddy what year is this?\\n\\n\\nStupid slug. I\\'ve never been so thirsty. \\nOh, come on! Go down already!  Ah!\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s so interesting. Maybe we could \\nget to know each other over a coffee.\\n\\n\\nLook, I know Flexo\\'s your friend but \\nI don\\'t trust him alone with the atom.\\n\\n\\nYeah well here\\'s a funny joke. I\\'m gonna \\nsit right here till it\\'s my shift.\\n\\n\\nSo, while you\\'re on the Probulator, \\ntell me, what brings you to the future?\\n\\n\\nProfessor, I\\'ve never seen you so cheerful. \\nWhat the hell\\'s wrong with you?\\n\\n\\nHey, why are those kids following you? \\nDo you have candy stuck to your ass?\\n\\n Negative. I must \\nbe a robot. Why else would human women \\nrefuse to date me?\\n\\n\\nHow did I do it? How did I get Leela \\nto love me? I\\'ve got to figure it out.\\n\\n\\nBender, I really hope that\\'s you. \\'Cause \\nif it isn\\'t......we\\'re in trouble!\\n\\n\\nI hope it\\'s a lager so I can take it \\nto a ball game.  Ooo! I felt that one!\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s no denying it: The future\\'s \\ncrazy! Oh, well. Don\\'t wanna stand out.\\n\\n\\nSo, what is Freedom Day? Sounds like \\nsome kind of feminine hygiene product.\\n\\n\\nThanks. These aren\\'t pockets they\\'re \\njust flaps. I put my money in my sock.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re not gonna believe this but they \\nlanded an amusement park on the moon!\\n\\n\\nGood, \\'cause I consider my fake relationship \\nwith you a lot more meaningful.\\n\\n\\nOh, look, I\\'m not actually interested \\nin her if that\\'s what\\'s bothering you.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s crazy! How could they even know \\nabout a show from a thousand years ago?\\n\\n\\nAlright, don\\'t get your panties in a \\nknot. We\\'ll just use the back-up dolly.\\n\\n\\nYou mean you have to choose between \\na life without sex and a gruesome death?\\n\\n It\\'s working, they think \\nwe\\'re making out.  Wait, why aren\\'t \\nwe making out?\\n\\n\\nNah. If I ever wanna go back to the \\nyear 2000 I\\'ll just freeze myself again.\\n\\n\\nBut why were you wearing that scarf, \\nthat turtleneck and this fruity number?\\n\\n\\nIt doesn\\'t matter how many human females \\nyou have, Bender\\'s on a hot streak.\\n\\n\\nOh the fools! If only they\\'d built it \\nwith 6001 hulls! When will they learn?\\n\\n\\nLook, so we\\'re not millionaires. At \\nleast we all still get to work together!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m experienced at foraging. I used \\nto find edible mushrooms on my bath \\nmat.\\n\\n\\nThis was the storage room. My dad spent \\nyears turning it into a bomb shelter.\\n\\n\\nHurry, the Golden Gate Bridge. Put the \\nmetal to the pedal to the other metal.\\n\\n\\nThis company\\'s on the fast track to \\nthe It List! Blast back kudos all around!\\n\\n\\nBut we have to! The world needs Star \\nTrek to give people hope for the future.\\n\\n\\nDamn! I knew you wouldn\\'t have asked \\nunless it was really high or really \\nlow.\\n\\n\\nWow! I love you guys! Back in the 20th \\ncentury, I had all five of your albums.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll tell them you went out prying the \\nwedding ring off his cold, dead finger.\\n\\n\\nYeah, well, good luck. It\\'d take some \\nkind of genius to count all those rings.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t find him here 10 minutes ago \\nso I thought it was time to check again.\\n\\n\\nYou know, Umbriel, these last 24 hours \\nhave been the happiest days of my life.\\n\\n\\nWords. Nothing sweet, sweet words that \\nturn into bitter orange wax in my ears.\\n\\n\\nWhoa! Check out that guy. He makes Speedy \\nGonzales look like Regular Gonzales.\\n\\n\\nSo you\\'re saying these aren\\'t the decaying \\nruins of New York in the year 4000?\\n\\n\\nSeriously, I can\\'t think of anything. \\nGotta find something to make me think. \\n\\n\\n\\nWho cares? We\\'re 35 points ahead with \\ntwo minutes left. What could possibly \\n-\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s alive!  Bender. What was it like \\nlying in that hole for a thousand years?\\n\\n\\nHurry! We\\'ve gotta think of another \\nway to save Bender or Xmas will be ruined!\\n\\n\\nLook, I\\'m trying to save someone here. \\nI\\'ll have to come back for those later.\\n\\n\\nLeela could beat that. She\\'s pitched \\nher whole career without getting an \\nout.\\n\\n\\nOh that\\'s also for Seymour. I\\'m getting \\neverything ready for when he\\'s cloned.\\n\\n\\nHey, wait! I\\'m having one of those things. \\nYou know? A headache with pictures?\\n\\n\\nIn the hospital. The ambulance brought \\nyou here right after the bee stung you.\\n\\n\\nI think the leak\\'s stopping itself. \\nWait. Wait. Yeah, there we go. Wait. \\nYeah!\\n\\n\\nThis junk isn\\'t garbage! I can dig in \\nany random pile and find something great.\\n\\n\\nOK, but what are the Brain Slugs who \\ncontrol you gonna do for the working \\nman?\\n\\n\\nYeah I\\'m a little confused too. How \\ndo I ... y\\'know ... with the tail and \\nall?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s been two weeks. You wanna play \\ntic-tac-toe again before we eat our \\nshoes?\\n\\n\\nWow! That ice dispenser\\'s so big, the \\nice crushes you!  Yakov Smirnov said \\nit!\\n\\n\\nOne year later I got beat up at a Neil \\nDiamond concert by a guy named Scrunchy!\\n\\n\\nIn the woods, I was walking. For Bigfoot, \\nlooking and then aliens beamed me up.\\n\\n\\nThis is awesome! I\\'ve been waiting a \\nthousand years to see a Beastie Boys \\nshow.\\n\\n\\nI know, we seem like a perfect match, \\nbut I just don\\'t feel that way about \\nher.\\n\\n\\nYep. My friend\\'s cousin\\'s caseworker \\nsaw one once. It\\'s a widely-believed \\nfact.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s this girl who I really like \\nbut she thinks I\\'m a jerk. Can you help \\nme?\\n\\n\\nWait. In my time, we had a way of moving \\nthings long distances without hovering.\\n\\n\\nYou guys are crazy. Leela doesn\\'t need \\nsurgery. You look great the way you \\nare.\\n\\n\\nMy roommate exploded. Oh, you gotta \\nhelp me, Bender. How can I prove I\\'m \\nhuman?\\n\\n\\nHey, you know what always cheers you \\nup? Baking me a nice tray of sugar cookies!\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it! I\\'m gonna deliver a gift \\nof my boot up Santa\\'s chimney. Where \\nis he?\\n\\n\\nNow let us each remember the best things \\nabout Bender in our own way. Professor?\\n\\n\\nAll this time we thought he was a powerful \\nsuper-being, yet he was just a child.\\n\\n\\nMightiness? Are you off your nut? I \\njust got kidnapped by a bunch of guineapigs.\\n\\n\\nPsst. There\\'s that robot child actor \\nwho grew up an robbed a convenience \\nstore!\\n\\n\\nCheck it out everyone. I\\'m back from \\nhell and I\\'ve got the Robot Devil\\'s \\nhands!\\n\\n\\nOh, no, my ATM card! My secret PIN number! \\n1077. I\\'ve got nothing left. Except...\\n\\n\\nHey, you know who loves secluded picnics \\nwith just you and me?  Uh, Dr. Zoidberg.\\n\\n\\nHey, I can get a date too. Now that \\nI\\'m single, I\\'ll attract all sorts of \\nwomen!\\n\\n\\nBender, if you say the A-word and you\\'ll \\nblow this planet straight to the H-word!\\n\\n\\nMr. Shore, I loved you in Bio-Dome. \\nYou sure caused some trouble in that \\nbubble!\\n\\n\\nAlright, fine. Everything else sucks. \\nAt least we can have a nice place to \\nlive.\\n\\n\\nBeing captain is obviously more important \\nto you than being my friend. I\\'m going.\\n\\n\\nHere\\'s the entrance.  From this moment \\non I declare my bad luck officially \\nover.\\n\\n\\nC\\'mon, Leela, why won\\'t you go out with \\nme? We both know there\\'s something there.\\n\\n\\nAnd also - for some reason - the letter \\nI wrote you full of my personal feelings.\\n\\n\\nThat was pretty cool. I think I\\'m actually \\nstarting to get interested in politics.\\n\\n\\nAlright, I\\'ll take the 500 lizards. \\nNo, wait, yes. No. Yes. Yes. Yes! The \\nparrot!\\n\\n\\nYeah keep laughing brineshrimp but he\\'s \\nbad news. I regret ever running him \\nover.\\n\\n\\nWell? How are they?  Oh, they\\'re great! \\nThey\\'re like sex! Except I\\'m having \\nthem!\\n\\n\\nWell, sure. To the extent a man can \\nlove a woman. But this seems like a \\nbig step.\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s so cute! He can do two things at \\none time: Eat and swim. Ooo - three \\nthings.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m real sorry I missed the mission. \\nI wasn\\'t there and you might have needed \\nme.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m at the input console. I\\'m a little \\nnervous and I\\'ve got brain in my buttcrack.\\n\\n\\nLeela!  You shouldn\\'t be listening. \\nI-I don\\'t want you to hear it \\'til it\\'s \\ndone.\\n\\n\\nCorrection. We\\'re unemployed but we \\nhave a doddering old relative to mooch \\noff of.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not a little kid, Leela. I grew \\nup in this city. These are my people. \\nWhat up?\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s the saltiest thing I\\'ve ever \\ntasted. And I once a big heaping bowl \\nof salt!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m gonna be a science-fiction hero, \\njust like Uhura, or Captain Janeway, \\nor Xena!\\n\\n\\nLook! Slurm! Finally!  Oh, yeah! I\\'m \\nnever going 12 minutes without a Slurm \\nagain.\\n\\n\\nThese are the candidates? They sound \\nlike clones.  Wait a minute. They are \\nclones!\\n\\n\\nJeez, we\\'re already planning to spend \\nValentine\\'s Day together. Isn\\'t that \\nenough?\\n\\n\\nI find this post-apocalyptic wasteland \\nvery confusing. Seriously, I\\'m weirded \\nout.\\n\\n\\nCome on, come on! Hey Leela, how \\'bout \\na kiss for good luck?  I meant tongue \\nluck.\\n\\n\\nPhil wins! Yancy\\'s fans are stunned! \\nThere\\'ll be no celebration at the Yancy \\ndome!\\n\\n\\nAnd the professor\\'s a senile, amoral \\ncrackpot.  Hermes is a Rastafarian accountant.\\n\\n\\nI refuse to testify on the grounds that \\nmy organs will be chopped up into a \\npatt�.\\n\\n\\nEh she sure is pretty. You ought to \\nmarry her and father some children right \\naway!\\n\\n\\nCertainly yes us! Uh-huh, sir! We\\'ve \\ngotta bring back the kind of Xmas I \\nremember.\\n\\n\\nYo, hook me up. My turkey is dry and \\nI\\'ve tried everything.  Oh right. Never \\nmind.\\n\\n\\nAnd we can tie these caterpillars together \\nto make bow strings for bows and arrows.\\n\\n\\nLet\\'s see what tools we\\'ll need.  Uh-huh, \\nUh-huh,  Uh-huh! Alright, we\\'re all \\nset.\\n\\n\\nOh wow. It\\'s like that drug trip I saw \\nin that movie when I was on that drug \\ntrip.\\n\\n\\nYeah, but I guess I\\'d be kinda angry \\ntoo if I had to go to some uninhabited \\nplanet.\\n\\n\\nOK, my friends. Get ready for the most \\ndelicious extinct animal you\\'ve ever \\ntasted.\\n\\n\\nGo ahead. Just chuck it any old place \\nlike I used to. Your city is counting \\non you.\\n\\n\\nEck! This emotional display is making \\nme nauseous.  Or maybe it\\'s whatever \\nthat is.\\n\\n\\nNope. Not vaccinated either! Besides. \\nIt\\'s not like one vote ever made a difference.\\n\\n\\nWait a second! That\\'s my name! Good \\nLord. He ditched his goofy name and \\nstole mine!\\n\\n\\nYou deserve it. I mean, nobody ever \\nstops to tell you what a great captain \\nyou are.\\n\\n\\nYou know what movies average out to \\nbe really good? The first six Star Trek \\nmovies!\\n\\n\\nCome on! Remember that episode where \\nyou go high on spores and smacked Kirk \\naround?\\n\\n It\\'s so hot \\nI poured McDonalds Coffee in my lap \\nto cool off.  Jonny Carson said it.\\n\\n\\nOK sheesh!  What happened to me, Philip \\nJ. Fry, on the night of December 31st \\n1999?\\n\\n\\nNope, uh-uh, eww!  Now look, this is \\nthe nose we want. Did you sell it to \\nsomebody?\\n\\n\\nWh-What if we helped you get your passion \\nback without the hassle of mutilating \\nme?\\n\\n\\nMan, it\\'s a total sty! For the first \\ntime in a thousand years, I feel like \\nI\\'m home.\\n\\n\\nYeah, it\\'s pretty romantic-- Uh, I mean \\nplatonic. Th-That sure is one platonic \\nview!\\n\\n\\nUh, maybe we should stick with people \\nwe know and trust. I mean, Flexo\\'s great \\nbut -\\n\\n\\nIt was called...let me think. It was \\nreally famous - Ruth Gordon had one. \\nThe wheel!\\n\\n\\nOK crow, prepare to be scared.  And \\nthen - honk honk - the car honked it\\'s \\nown horn!\\n\\n\\nHank Aaron XXIV? How could you play \\nso blowfully? The original Hank Aaron \\nwas great!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s no use. We\\'ve been to ever scuzzy \\nbazaar in the galaxy, including Pottery \\nBarn.\\n\\n\\nUh, listen, is there maybe some way \\nwe could do this with you going and \\nme not going?\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t girl me with that girl stuff. \\nBender and me are guys. Guys don\\'t have \\nfeelings.\\n\\n\\nYeah, well, I did open the account over \\na thousand years ago. What about my \\nATM card?\\n\\n\\nPine needles. Oh, man, this is great! \\nHey, as long as you don\\'t make me smell \\nUranus.\\n\\n\\nUm, let me think. Come and knock on \\nour door, nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh nuh. Uh, \\nMr Roper--\\n\\n\\nHey, pretty nice for a single. Two desks, \\ntwo chairs, a couple of beds.  A woodpecker.\\n\\n\\nGoodbye, friends. I never thought I \\nwould die like this. But I\\'d always \\nreally hoped.\\n\\n Yeehah! Bow before your master, \\npuny mortals! Whoo! Giddy-up! Ha ha! \\nWoohoo! Whoopie!\\n\\n\\nWell, I don\\'t remember any of that but \\nI don\\'t have the wherewithal to defend \\nmyself.\\n\\n\\nAh, so the real gift Spargle gave you \\nwas confidence. The confidence to be \\nyour best.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'re gonna die! It\\'s every man for \\nhimself!  Help me, Leela!  You did it! \\nWe\\'re safe!\\n\\n\\nHey, it\\'s your fault. He only flushed \\nhimself because your emotions made him \\nfeel bad.\\n\\n\\nUh, I can explain that. See, it used \\nto be milk and, well, time makes fools \\nof us all.\\n\\n\\nIf I were in charge I wouldn\\'t treat \\nyou like this. You\\'re nothing but a \\nbig blowhard.\\n\\n\\nOh, no, I\\'m boned! I haven\\'t paid into \\nthe pension either. What\\'ll I do when \\nI retire?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m too scared to find my pocket. Here, \\nI\\'ll just take of my pants and give \\nyou those.\\n\\n\\nWe\\'ve been looking for you. Last we \\nheard you were under arrest as a human \\nsympathiser.\\n\\n\\nI know Big Vinnie said he was giving \\nme the kiss of death but I still think \\nhe was gay.\\n\\n\\nAmy, I really like you, as a friend. \\nBut I think we\\'re spending too much \\ntime together.\\n\\n\\nWell, we\\'ll be leaving now. If you\\'ll \\njust sign this form saying you received \\nthe atom.\\n\\n\\nSure.  Y\\'know, I think I finally figured \\nout what\\'s behind all these mysterious \\ndeaths.\\n\\n\\nI hid it in a secret hiding place who\\'s \\nlocation I never told anyone. Not even \\nScruffy.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve still got a trick or two up my \\nsleeve. Watch as I fire up through our \\nown shields.\\n\\n\\nGo ahead. I deserve it. I wish those \\nstupid racoons had never brought me \\nto the future.\\n\\n\\nWait a second. You\\'re a bender, right? \\nWe can get out of here if you just bend \\nthe bars.\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe they threw me out like \\nthat. I must have been really acting \\nlike a jerk.\\n\\n\\nI guess that just leaves you and your \\nfake fianc� ... all alone ... on a romatic \\ncruise.\\n\\n\\nVery impressive. Back in the 20th century \\nwe had no idea there was a university \\non Mars.\\n\\n\\nLook, Guenter, if you\\'re so miserable \\nhere, maybe you should just go back \\nto the jungle.\\n\\n\\nHe\\'s much worse. He drinks, he smokes \\nand he posts naked pictures of me on \\nthe internet.\\n\\n\\nWhat Bender means is, you\\'re really \\nbrave, and smart, and beautiful, and \\na great friend.\\n\\n\\nProfessor, please. The fate of the world \\ndepends on you getting to second base \\nwith Mom.\\n\\n You jerk. I thought I was \\nyour best friend. What kind of two-timing \\nkill-mobile are you?\\n\\n\\nGiant Space Robot, this is Captain Fry \\nof the USS Planet Express Ship; We come \\nin peace.\\n\\n\\nYou ate most of them. So, where\\'s Captain \\nBender? Off catastrophising some other \\nplanet?\\n\\n\\nYou mean we can never catch up to him? \\nNot even if we rub the engine with cheetah \\nblood?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve got to redeem myself. Somehow, \\nsometime, for some reason. I\\'ll block \\nthis takeover!\\n\\n\\nBut, should superheroes commit crime? \\nEven to save lives? I need moral guidance. \\nBender?\\n\\n\\nOh Nibbler, at least I\\'m important to \\nyou. Even if it\\'s only \\'cause I clean \\nup you poop.\\n\\n\\nWell at least I did one important thing \\nwith my life. Leading good to victory \\nover evil!\\n\\n\\nThis isn\\'t Yemeni! It\\'s Sulowesi!  And \\nthe cup\\'s shaking I don\\'t want my coffee \\nshaking!\\n\\n\\nNothing is impossible. You\\'d know that \\nif you really took after the Professor, \\nlike I do.\\n\\n\\nAll right! Hey. Wait a minute! This \\nis your home planet? We\\'re the evil, \\ninvading aliens?\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s the same reason they kept me \\nout of school. So, no one even cared \\nthat I was gone?\\n\\n\\nObviously you\\'ve never been in love! \\nOw!  Ow!  Ow!  Now, the hand-eye co-ordination \\nlobe.\\n\\n\\nHm. A giant brain is basically a giant \\nnerd. And where would a giant nerd be? \\nThe libary!\\n\\n\\nWhy do you always have to steal everything \\nfrom me Yancy? Find your own life and \\nlive it.\\n\\n\\nThis is it! My Ronco Record Vault!  \\nI still remember the combination.  Three. \\nIt\\'s stuck.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s my brother Yancy! And there in \\nhis lapel - my seven leaf clover! I \\nknew he stole it.\\n\\n\\nOh, right. Plus, the magnet screws up \\nyour inhibition unit and makes you sing \\nfolk songs.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not fair. In my day Xmas was supposed \\nto bring people together, not blow them \\napart!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s moving too fast. Oh I could never \\nget the last one. My brother always \\ngot it for me!\\n\\n I\\'m sorry, Leela, I can\\'t \\ngo on any further. Just leave me to \\ndie in that barn over there.\\n\\n\\nLeela, I just want you to know that \\neven though you\\'re mean, you\\'re the \\nbest captain ever.\\n\\n\\nI wish they\\'d just wipe out humanity \\nand get it over with. It\\'s the waiting \\nI can\\'t stand.\\n\\n It\\'s my invention, we do it \\nmy way! Now all we need is something \\nto pull it and we\\'re set!\\n\\n\\nYet the Zookeeper escaped. Thus proving \\nthat the deadliest animal of all is \\nthe Zookeeper!\\n\\n\\n...My whole world is gone. You can\\'t \\npossibly understand what it feels like \\nto be so alone.\\n\\n\\nWe can definitely escape, Bender. All \\nyou have to do is bend the hatch off \\nthis steam pipe.\\n\\n\\nBut, but...Bender need brain...for...smart \\nmaking!  What did you do now? Stop doing \\nthings!\\n\\n\\nThat jerk! No one hoots at my captain \\nunless they\\'re prepared to take it to \\nthe next level!\\n\\n\\nYeah. But now its the distant future. \\nWhy aren\\'t we out doing everything I \\never dreamed of?\\n\\n\\nWhoa! Letters like \"U\" and \"R\" can mean \\nwords like \"You\" and \"Are.\" Here Leela, \\nU-R-2 Cute!\\n\\n\\nIs it this room that\\'s making you sad? \\nIt\\'s probably the room. Come on, lets \\ngo for a walk.\\n\\n\\nWow, I must say I\\'m impressed. You look \\njust like a ball player. Can I pat you \\non the butt?\\n\\n\\nOf course I do! Bigfoot\\'s my hero. Growing \\nup, he was the celebrity I most identified \\nwith.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not going out with Amy. It\\'s just \\nto fool her parents. Hey, you\\'re not \\njealous, are you?\\n\\n\\nAlright, bird, you thought you could \\nbeat me in a game of wits. But you just \\nmet your equal.\\n\\n\\nWhoa whoa, you mean Bender is the evil \\nBender? I am shocked, shocked! Well \\nnot that shocked.\\n\\n\\nBender, if this is some kind of scam, \\nI don\\'t get it. You already have my \\npower of attorney.\\n\\n\\nBender? No! He\\'s an old fashioned one \\nspaceship robot. Look I\\'ll tell him \\nyou stopped by OK?\\n\\n\\nWhoa! They discovered an intact, 20th \\nCentury pizzeria! Just like the one \\nI used to work at!\\n\\n\\nOh, hello sir. It\\'s a lovely evening \\nyou have tonight. Um I\\'m here to pick \\nup your daughter.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s hopeless. I can hear all this great \\nmusic in my head but my stupid hands \\ncan\\'t keep up.\\n\\n\\nAww, this isn\\'t right. Listen, Bender, \\nif we found your antenna could they \\nstill reattach it?\\n\\n\\nAh, I dunno. That\\'s a chick show. I \\nprefer programmes of the genre \"world\\'s \\nblankiest blank\".\\n\\n\\nWait, Mount Rushmore and the Leaning \\nTower of Pisa? I didn\\'t know they were \\nboth in New York!\\n\\n\\nNope.  No one in New York drove. There \\nwas too much traffic.  Nice! Listen \\nto that baby purr!\\n\\n\\nI tell you, that Butch runs a pretty \\ngood civilisation. I think I\\'ll enjoy \\nserving under him.\\n\\n\\nI did. I think. It was probably about \\n50/50. But that\\'s how I really felt \\nabout you, I swear!\\n\\n\\nWell I\\'m gonna take action. It\\'s time \\nto check on my retirement fund.  Damn! \\nStill only $100.\\n\\n\\nOh, good, a physical! Once they examine \\nmy fragile, naked, pink body, they\\'ll \\nsee I\\'m not a--\\n\\n\\nHey, and while we\\'re on the base I\\'ll \\nvisit my grandfather Enos! He was stationed \\nat Roswell.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t think so. \\'Cause as vice chairman \\nof the company I gain voting control \\nof his shares.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m no good at being a slave. I\\'m thinking \\nabout graduate school. Y\\'know? To become \\na barber?\\n\\n\\nBlech! We have to track down my nose \\nbefore some alien snarfs it and does \\nthe worm. Who\\'s in?\\n\\n\\nYes. And I have a message for you from \\nColonel Mitumba! He says this......is \\nfrom Congo Jack.\\n\\n\\nMan, Leela\\'s been gone a long time. \\nI hope she\\'s at least making progress \\nwith Zapp Brannigan.\\n\\n\\nWow! An old-fashioned mosh pit! Come \\non guys. Tonight we\\'re gonna party like \\nits 1999...again.\\n\\n\\nAnd the people are all phoneys. No one \\nreads. Everything has cilantro on it \\n-  Michelle, baby!\\n\\n\\nI had no choice. I was about to not \\nexist. I could feel myself fading away, \\nlike Greg Kinnear.\\n\\n\\nSo who should I root for? America or \\none of those countries I learned about \\nat the Food Court?\\n\\n\\n3000? Yes! I\\'m still in the future! \\nLife is wonderful!  Wait! What are you \\ndoing with my stuff?\\n\\n\\nNow that you mention it, I do have trouble \\nbreathing underwater sometimes. I\\'ll \\ntake the gills.\\n\\n\\nFine. I\\'ll let go and swim around in \\nthe Slurm and drink as much as I want. \\nHelp! I can\\'t swim!\\n\\n\\nYup, I remember. They came in last at \\nthe Olympics then retired to promote \\nalcoholic beverages.\\n\\n\\nWow, it\\'s too bad you can\\'t see Leela \\n\\'cause theres a cool ship out there \\nshooting at somebody.\\n\\n\\nNo, it can\\'t, but it\\'s got a driver\\'s-side \\nfloor and an 8-track player with genuine \\nmono sound.\\n\\n\\nWhoa, whoa, whoa, wait, Bender. So long \\nas we\\'re here why don\\'t we take in some, \\nexotic dancing!\\n\\n\\nUh-oh. Is this gonna be another crazy \\nexperiment that crosses a line Man was \\nnot meant to cross?\\n\\n\\nLooks like Bender learned an important \\nlesson about respecting other people\\'s \\nfeelings afterall.\\n\\n\\nI hear that. I spent most of my teen \\nyears loving my body. Course, it was \\ntough love but -- ooh!\\n\\n\\nJust out of curiosity, we could use \\nthe cards to buy gum, then immediately \\nquit the army, right?\\n\\n\\nThis is all my fault. I let my best \\nfriend risk his life just to get my \\ndead dog back.  Bender!!\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t watch this \\'cause it\\'s creepy \\nand wrong and sick. However I will watch \\nout of curiosity.\\n\\n\\nHow could you, Leela? I thought you \\nhad some standards. I mean, jeez, he\\'s \\na dumb, gross gorilla!\\n\\n\\nWow! You got that off the Internet? \\nIn my day the Internet was only used \\nto download pornography.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re the last store open. I need something \\nfor my friend Leela.  Just give me your \\nbest animal.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t mean to nitpick, super-doc, \\nbut do you think maybe you could take \\none more whack at this?\\n\\n\\nOh Leela. I feel terrible. If there\\'s \\nanything I can ever do -  Gotcha!  I \\nwon! I\\'m the greatest!\\n\\n Bio-units, terminate \\nnoise exchange. It is time for you to \\ningest sandwiches from my compartment.\\n\\n\\nI had no idea the company would be sold. \\nI was just an innocent suck up. You\\'ve \\ngotta believe me!\\n\\n\\nLeela, I think you\\'re missing the big \\npicture. When you were a kid what was \\nyour biggest fantasy?\\n\\n\\nHuh. Did everything just taste purple \\nfor a second? Oh well. Let\\'s go home \\nyou dumb poop machine.\\n\\n\\'S PHOTO\\nI don\\'t know if you can hear me Leela \\nbut there\\'s something I wanna tell you. \\nI love you.\\n\\n\\nWell Bender, I hope this has taught \\nyou a lesson about changing your sex \\nto win five gold medals.\\n\\n\\nWell, you were gonna live in the closet \\nanyway. Won\\'t you be just as happy back \\nin your old place?\\n\\n\\nToo bad he wasn\\'t an alligator. Y\\'know, \\nwhen you flush those things they stay \\nalive in the sewers.\\n\\n\\nSo, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy. And \\nI hope there are no hard feelings about \\nyour date, or stuff.\\n\\n\\nHey jumbo! How would you like it if \\nLeela said you were sexy and she wanted \\nto make love with you?\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe Leela and Amy aren\\'t \\nback yet from their half-date. I\\'m gonna \\ncall the restaurant.\\n\\n\\nThen when I feel so stuffed I can\\'t \\neat anymore, I just use the restroom, \\nand then I can eat more.\\n\\n\\nSure! It\\'s the price of a cheese pizza \\nand a large soda back where I used to \\nwork, Panucci\\'s Pizza.\\n\\n\\nHey, uh, Guenter? Why don\\'t you get \\nup on the chandelier with your parents \\nand I\\'ll take a picture?\\n\\n\\nOK, my best friend\\'s life is at stake. \\nI can finally prove that I\\'m not a coward. \\nWill you push me?\\n\\n\\nThat clover helped my ratfink brother \\nsteal my dream of going into space. \\nNow I\\'ll never get there.\\n\\n\\nWait a minute, Bender is my best friend. \\nWe can\\'t just dump him in the gutter \\nlike Grandma\\'s ashes.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m nobody. There are guys in the background \\nwith Mary Worth comics who are more \\nimportant than me.\\n\\n\\nThis is awesome! Are we gonna fly through \\nspace fighting monsters and teaching \\nalien women to lurve?\\n\\n\\nJeez, will you lay off! I was delivering \\nthings before you were born! I think \\nI know what I\\'m doing.\\n\\n\\nYou don\\'t have to beat around the bush, \\nLeela, we all know who you\\'re talking \\nabout...uh, me, right?\\n\\n\\nI never thought it would end this way: \\nGunned down by Santa Claus. Honestly, \\nI didn\\'t see it coming!\\n\\n\\nUh, I\\'m flattered, really. If I was \\ngonna do it with a big, freaky mud bug \\nyou\\'d be way up the list!\\n\\n\\nI shouldn\\'t be here. I shouldn\\'t even \\nexist. But I do which proves...you can\\'t \\nreally be my grandm -\\n\\n\\nThis is Fry. If you\\'re calling about \\nthe used towels for sale, they\\'re still \\navailable for $45 each.\\n\\n\\nLeela we got lucky this time but you \\nshould be more careful. I don\\'t want \\nanything to happen to you.\\n\\n\\nWho cares what you\\'re programmed for. \\nIf someone programmed you to jump off \\na bridge would you do it?\\n\\n\\nRight! I, Fry, who drank Bont the Viscous, \\nwho drank Ungo the Moist, who guzzled \\nZorn the Stagnant...\\n\\n Thanks, everybody. I love you \\nall. You guys are true -- ow! Cut it \\nout, Bender! That\\'s a tender area!\\n\\n\\nLook! It\\'s our nebula. Whenever I see \\nit I\\'ll think back to that moment when \\nwe almost--  Never mind!\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been there. My folks were always \\non me to groom myself and wear underpants. \\nWhat am I, the Pope?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s called a van, and in light of the \\nfact that it\\'s not a-rockin\\', I invite \\nyou to come a-knockin\\'!\\n\\n\\nBender, I don\\'t claim to understand \\n\"the biz\" but wouldn\\'t being able to \\nmove help your music career?\\n\\n\\nI learned how to work the gravity pump \\ntoo. In case we need to move more stars. \\nSo are we dating now?\\n\\n\\nAnd then, and then, this giant tapeworm \\ntried to play us for chumps but we like \\ntotally dissed Moose!\\n\\n\\nBut I wouldn\\'t even know what to write \\nabout. Unless...  OK I\\'ll do it. If \\nI can make it about Leela.\\n\\n\\nSo that\\'s where those skin flakes went. \\nHmm, do you think this fruit tree\\'s \\ngoing to get enough light?\\n\\n\\nYeah. If she had let us use the back-up \\ndolly, we could have broken it, given \\nup and gone home by now.\\n\\n\\nI didn\\'t come here to see any activity \\ninvolving two guys. Where do you people \\ndo your erotic display?\\n\\n\\nWould you cram a sock in it Bender? \\nThose aren\\'t even medals! They\\'re bottlecaps \\nand pepperoni slices.\\n\\n\\nI sure do! That\\'s the real robber and \\nI\\'ll never forget his name as long as \\nI live. And that name is--\\n\\n\\nHey, I have an idea. Who wants to cram \\nin my van and follow Bender on tour \\nand live there, in the van?\\n\\n\\nOh!  That\\'s how I must have done it! \\nI moved the stars themselves to write \\nher a love note in the sky.\\n\\n\\nThen today\\'s your lucky day because \\nI happen to be a holding, stroking, \\nlovin\\' machine! Also spankin\\'!\\n\\n\\nYou know the worst thing about being \\na slave? They make you work but they \\ndon\\'t pay you or let you go.\\n\\n\\nSir, I\\'m outfitting an expedition to \\na monestary high in the Himalayas. I\\'ll \\nneed a long sleeved coat.\\n\\n\\nThat telescope is as much mine as it \\nis anybody\\'s. I\\'m using it whether you \\ngive me permission or not.\\n\\n\\nBelieve it or not, I have more important \\nthings to do today than laugh and clap \\nmy hands.  Reschedule.\\n\\n\\nHey, I was frozen. I think I know what \\npeople wanna hear when they first wake \\nup.  Bathroom\\'s that way.\\n\\n\\nBrothers and sisters, get your love \\nbeads. Can\\'t journey to the centre of \\nyour mind without love beads!\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s a lot about my face you don\\'t \\nknow. Perhaps you and it could get better \\nacquainted over dinner.\\n\\n\\nThat jeep\\'s gonna hit him! And I won\\'t \\nexist anymore!  Are you crazy? You almost \\ngot yourself run over!\\n\\n\\nMr. Nimoy, I came as soon as I heard \\nwhat happened centuries ago. I can\\'t \\nbelieve your show was banned.\\n\\n\\nYou mean you flipped the coin too? And \\nit was tails? So that\\'s why you said \\nyou had to meet that ghost.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m capable of making my own decisions, \\nLeela. Did you ever stop to think I \\nmight be happier with gills?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know, I don\\'t know. Just say \\nanything. As long as it\\'s compelling, \\nmesmerising, a tour de force.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m telling you, Leela was cool, she \\nwas in command, and when she kicked \\npeople it hurt. It really hurt.\\n\\n\\nOh, alright. How \\'bout this? What if \\nI never fell into that freezer-doodle \\nand came to the future-jiggy?\\n\\n\\nHm, Spider, Hubble, Nitrogum...ooh, \\nBig Pink! It\\'s the only gum with the \\nbreath-freshening power of ham.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m never going to get used to the 31st \\ncentury.  Caffinated bacon? Baconated \\ngrapefruit? Admiral Crunch?\\n\\n Sure I can. I learned how \\nto handle delicate social situations \\nfrom a little show called Three\\'s Company.\\n\\n Why couldn\\'t she be the other \\ntype of mermaid, with the fish part \\non top and the lady part on the bottom?\\n\\n\\nMaybe that planet over there has a \\ndrive-thru. A Burger Jerk or a Fishy \\nJoe\\'s or a Chizzler or something.\\n\\n\\nYes. But it\\'s only recently I\\'ve been \\nable to articulate my thoughts. I love \\nyou Leela and I always have.\\n\\n\\nBender, wait! This is our chance to \\nescape, before Melllvar comes back. \\nBut we all need to work together.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it! I\\'m getting a hundred cups \\nof coffee! Starting now.  Coffee machine, \\none cup of coffee please.\\n\\n\\nSir, if I may, why don\\'t you set up \\nlike a billion video cameras in the \\nwoods and see if he walks by one.\\n\\n\\nIt could be my beautiful soul sitting \\nnaked on her couch if I could just learn \\nto play this stupid thing.\\n\\n\\nIt really puts things in perspective. \\nI mean, from up here an entire world \\ncan seem utterly insignificant.\\n\\n\\nI just wanted to do something to make \\nyou happy. I mean, I miss my family \\nbut you never even had a family.\\n\\n\\nNo thanks. I just came to tell you that \\nZoidberg\\'s really great. He\\'s got male \\njelly coming out the wazoo.\\n\\n\\nThen she wants me as a trophy husband. \\nLeela, you gotta come to Europa with \\nus, I can\\'t be alone with her.\\n\\n\\nWell, you guys might both be losers \\nbut I just made out with that radiator \\nwoman from the radiator planet.\\n\\n\\nWhoa, whoa, girl. I thought you were \\ntalking about one of those motels where \\nthe bed is shaped like stuff.\\n\\n\\nBut you\\'re better than normal, you\\'re \\nabnormal. If you ask me, you shouldn\\'t \\ncare what other people think.\\n\\n Thirty days hath September, \\nApril, June and ... wonder ... is that \\npeanut butter ... what am I gonna do? \\n\\n\\n\\nRelax, mammal. My robotic software shall \\nmeet your calculatory needs.  What is \\nthe meaning of this symbol?\\n\\n\\nI\\'d prefer someone from the era of shaved \\nunderarms. Do you have anything with \\na more Lucy Liu feel to it?\\n\\n\\nOh, poor Bender. He must be so lonely \\nright now. Trapped a thousand years \\nin the past. Hey! Wait a second!\\n\\n\\nAw c\\'mon, you guys have forever to look \\nfor God. All I\\'m asking is one measley \\nlifetime to find my friend.\\n\\n\\nThink about it. Seymour lived a full \\nlife after I was gone. He probably added \\nnew songs to his repertoire.\\n\\n\\nYou gotta tell me. You\\'re not actually \\nattracted to Calculon right? And if \\nyou are don\\'t tell me. Are you?\\n\\n\\nMy God! It\\'s the future. My parents, \\nmy co-workers, my girlfriend. I\\'ll never \\nsee any of them again. Yahoo!\\n\\n\\nAre you still mad at me for wrecking \\nyour once in a lifetime chance to learn \\nthe meaning of your existence?\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it. I\\'ve had it with women. From \\nnow on, I\\'m concentrating on my career. \\nCan I have my old job back?\\n\\n\\nHi Leela! I\\'m just gonna keep talking, \\neven if you can\\'t hear me. Blah blah \\nblah, blah blah blah blah blah.\\n\\n\\nWait! I remember this place. They shut \\nit down after all those people caught \\nsalmonella from the flume ride.\\n\\n\\nHey, tell me something: You\\'ve got all \\nthis money, how come you always dress \\nlike you\\'re doing your laundry?\\n\\n\\nThen I have no choice but to do something \\nso pitiful and embarrassing that I\\'m \\nashamed to tell you about it.\\n\\n\\nPah. I\\'d have won a lot of money too \\nif I still had my lucky seven leaf clover. \\nPlus I\\'d still have my hair.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it! This place is too dangerous. \\nWe\\'ve gotta get you out of here!  Everything\\'s \\ngonna be alright Dad!\\n\\n\\nSo that\\'s my story Father Changstein \\nel Gamahl. Is there anything religion \\ncan do to help me find my friend?\\n\\n\\nThey\\'re scared of our raw power. Oh \\nbut if you want a job, I could beg everyone \\nat the company where I work.\\n\\n\\nWow! A superpowers drug you can just \\nrub into your skin? You\\'d think it\\'d \\nbe something you have to freebase.\\n\\n\\nUh, yeah. We\\'ll have one with everything \\nbut anchovies and one with my all time \\nfavourite topping, anchovies!\\n\\n\\nSo, Chrissy, we seem to be hitting it \\noff. If you\\'re not doing anything later \\nmight I escort you to a kegger?\\n\\n\\nWow! There\\'s a million aliens. I\\'ve \\nnever seen anything so mind blowing. \\nOoh, a reception table with muffins!\\n\\n\\nWhy exactly did you shave your legs \\nanyway? Are you expecting something \\nto happen with your Valentine\\'s date?\\n\\n\\nCome on freedom cage! Roll me to safety! \\nYes! I never thought I\\'d escape with \\nmy doodle, but I pulled it out!\\n\\n\\nSeems to be. My neck\\'s just a little \\ntender.  Ow! Cool!  Ow! Listen, Leela. \\nThanks for rescuing me last night.\\n\\n\\nMan, I thought Ultimate Robot Fighting \\nwas real, like pro wrestling. But it \\nturns out it\\'s fixed, like boxing.\\n\\n\\nUh, \"video game\" you say? Well golly \\ngee, you mighty spacemen of the future \\nwill have to show me how it works.\\n\\n\\nNo fair. Leela was training me to be \\ncaptain. She even let me sit in her \\nlap and steer - in this comic I drew.\\n\\n\\nYeah. But I don\\'t guess anything I could \\ndo will ever make you feel the same \\nway about me that I do about you.\\n\\n\\nWell, usually on the show someone would \\ncome up with a complicated plan then \\nexplain it with a simple analogy.\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe we flew halfway across \\nthe galaxy and enjoyed a steam just \\nto get lunch for that stupid animal!\\n\\n\\nMan, that\\'s dog\\'s gonna be hard to beat. \\nLook at him bring in the sheep! One \\nsheep, two sheep......three sheep.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve never seen a supernova blow up. \\nBut if it\\'s anything like my old Chevy \\nNova, it\\'ll light up the night sky!\\n\\n\\nOK, we\\'re in the middle of nowhere, \\nwhich is the safest part of nowhere. \\nJust stay put and enjoy this calendar.\\n\\n\\nThen it\\'s a deal. We get one night. \\nI keep my horn as long as you two end \\nup doing the horizontal monster mash.\\n\\n\\nI feel like a rat. Here I am whining \\nlike a pig while all along Leela was \\nlonely as a frog. I could kick myself.\\n\\n\\nHey, you guys, the most amazing thing \\nhappened. It\\'s two-for-one Tuesday at \\nKrispy Kreme! Plus there\\'s mermaids.\\n\\n\\nAh, the scent of a rose. Curious how \\nan aromatic chain of hydrocarbons can \\nevoke our deepest emotions.  For you.\\n\\n\\nAlright, its Saturday night. I have \\nno date, a two litre bottle of Shasta, \\nand my all Rush mix tape! Let\\'s rock!\\n\\n\\nWoo yeah! Hit him hit him hit him!  \\nNow this is the high life! Watching \\napes mangle each other near celebrities!\\n\\n\\nBack in my day, we didn\\'t have your \\nfancy all-digital weapons but we still \\nmanaged to kill each other just fine.\\n\\n\\nWhatever. The correct answer is: To \\nbe a superhero. We have superpowers \\nand we\\'re Americans. This is our chance.\\n\\n\\nStinger went right through me and you \\ngot all the poison. My new spleen came \\nfrom a guy who liked to motorcycle.\\n\\n\\nLeela, your scaredness is being transmitted \\nstraight to Bender. If you care about \\nNibbler, stop caring about him!\\n\\n\\nMmm. Mmm! Now this is what I call a \\nthousand years of progress: A Bavarian \\ncreamdog that\\'s also self-microwaving!\\n\\n\\nLeela, I want you to know I think the \\nway you moved those stars around was \\nreally wonderful. I got you something.\\n\\n\\nNot big enough. We need something that \\ncan take out an entire army. Something \\nyou could commit a war crime with--\\n\\n\\nBender, I\\'m alive!  You didn\\'t hurt \\nme at all. But I know you wanted to, \\nand that\\'s what matters.  Here\\'s to \\nyou.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve only got two fantasies left: Be \\ninvisible in a chocolate factory and \\nbe romantically linked with a celebrity.\\n\\n\\nBut this is Lucy Liu! Perhaps the only \\ngood actress of the 21st century! She\\'s \\nmore than just a piece of software.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s not an astronaut, it\\'s a TV comedian. \\nAnd he was just using space travel as \\na metaphor for beating his wife.\\n\\n\\nWell, thanks to the internet, I\\'m bored \\nwith sex. Is there a place on the web \\nthat panders to my lust for violence?\\n\\n\\nHe may be some lowlife jerk but I don\\'t \\ntrust him. I think he\\'s hiding something \\nand I\\'m gonna find out what it is.\\n\\n\\nLook! There\\'s been a terrible mistake. \\nI\\'m a human being. See?  I\\'m all squishy \\nand flabby. Also, I complain a lot.\\n\\n\\nDo we have to? I mean they\\'re monks. \\nI\\'m sure their God will let them out \\nor at least give them more shoes to \\neat.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t wave your fancy degrees at me. \\nI recognise all this stuff.  Petrified \\nsausages, Old Mr Patelli, and that\\'s \\n-\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s what I\\'m trying to tell you. \\nSee -  Why are you all staring at me \\nlike that? Is there something on my \\nface?\\n\\n\\nHey! A phone booth! I can call my nephew. \\nWow, a real live robot! Or is that \\nsome kind of cheesy New Year\\'s costume?\\n\\n\\nWell, we missed the premiere and we\\'re \\ngonna die. We might as well enjoy the \\nsights.  Oh my God, Sylvester Stallone!\\n\\n\\nThis is so unfair! I liked you back \\nwhen you were a cyclops! That guy\\'s \\nonly interested now that you have two \\neyes.\\n\\n\\nAww, you guys came to watch me make \\nout! That is so sweet.  Wait a minute! \\nIs that the head of who I think it\\'s \\nof?\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll miss you buddy. You\\'ve been like \\na brother and then a sister to me. And \\nnow you\\'re getting married. I love you.\\n\\n\\nI heard that one time you single-handedly \\ndefeated a horde of rampaging somethings \\nin the something something system.\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe it. She\\'s risking her \\nlife for me after the way I treated \\nher. I don\\'t deserve this. I feel terrible.\\n\\n\\nWait a second. I\\'m getting an idea. \\nN-No, false alarm. No. Yeah. No. Yeah. \\nNo. Wait. No. Yeah. Yeah. No ... no. \\nYes!\\n\\n\\nListen, Doc, if you wanna score you \\ngotta fake like you\\'re in love.  Just \\nlook her in the eye, start crying and \\nsay \\n\\n\\nOh my God! They dug up a bag of olestra \\nchips from my time!  There must be layers \\nand layers of old stuff down there.\\n\\n\\nY\\'know, I saw the first 30 seconds of \\nthat episode. If I could make up an \\nending, maybe we could act it out ourselves.\\n\\n\\nHmm. According to this map, the only \\nway out is through ... that pipe.  Don\\'t \\nworry. It gets wider after about a mile.\\n\\n\\nEh, what\\'s the worst thing that could \\nhappen?  Ugh, it\\'s like there\\'s a party \\nin my mouth and everyone\\'s throwing \\nup!\\n\\n\\nSo, Leela, how about a romantic ride \\nin one of those swan boats? They\\'re \\nkinda dangerous but I finally mastered \\nthem.\\n\\n\\nAmy, you won\\'t believe what happened......it \\nwas so scary that you wouldn\\'t -  I \\nknow but listen it gets even scarier.\\n\\n\\nYou see? TV audiences don\\'t want anything \\noriginal. They wanna see the same thing \\nthey\\'ve seen a thousand times before.\\n\\n\\nLooks like we\\'re under Park Avenue. \\nOoh, ritzy! Just think: All this was \\nprobably once a charity luncheon for \\nthe Met.\\n\\n\\nOoo I have one. I\\'m good at video games \\nand bad at everything else. That\\'s why \\nI wish life were more like a video game.\\n\\n\\nBees make honey and jelly? Huh. How \\ncome nothing humans make taste good? \\nHelp! I can\\'t swim in jelly as far \\nas I know!\\n\\n\\nGood!  Don\\'t finish that cruller, throw \\nit away  Bender. Drink that beer and \\ndrop the bottle on the ground.  Very \\nnice.\\n\\n\\nBut that\\'s not why people watch TV. \\nClever things make people feel stupid, \\nand unexpected things make them feel \\nscared.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know. I got nervous and started \\nthinking about neck bolts.  Wow! Did \\nyou see that vase break? It was all \\nlike -\\n\\n\\nHey! Thinking hurts him. Maybe I can \\nthink of a way to use that.  Aha! Prepare \\nto be thought at. Leela, give me a topic.\\n\\n\\nSo? I\\'m just as important as him.  It\\'s \\njust that, the kind of importance I \\nhave, it doesn\\'t matter if I...don\\'t \\ndo it.\\n\\n\\nJunk? Maybe you can\\'t understand this \\nbut I\\'ve finally found what I need to \\nbe happy, and it\\'s not friends: It\\'s \\nthings.\\n\\n\\nAll Leela ever wanted to do was help \\nme. But I was to proud, too stupid to \\naccept it.  I wish I had died instead \\nof her.\\n\\n\\nHey! You have no right to criticise \\nthe 20th century. We gave the world \\nthe lightbulb, the steamboat and the \\ncotton gin.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s a stupid animal. You\\'re stupid! \\nI said I want the best one. Now which \\ncosts more? The parrot or the Stink \\nLizard?\\n\\n\\nHey, yeah! I used to spit at stuff back \\nin the 20th century. Ah, it\\'s cool how \\nwe sort of think exactly alike, and \\njunk.\\n\\n\\nBender come on. We\\'ve got to get some \\ndirt on Alkazar. Lets go and find out \\nwhat makes the Forbidden Valley so forbidden.\\n\\n\\nAww. Poor little guy. Let me just take \\na look at - aha!  I won! I\\'m the new \\nchief! I\\'m the tallest and I weigh the \\nmost!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s all lies every word of it! He wasn\\'t \\noriginal, he wasn\\'t a Martian, he wasn\\'t \\nPhilip Fry and since when is he a the?\\n\\n\\nYou gotta get me out of here. I would \\nhave starved to death if not for that \\nsick vending machine robot.  Gimmie! \\nGimmie!\\n\\n\\nLook, Leela. I know there\\'s some perfect, \\namazing thing I can do to make you love \\nme, and when I figure out what it is \\n-\\n\\n\\nShe\\'s so great. I feel like I can almost \\nremember the magical thing I did to \\nmake her love me. But I guess I never \\nwill.\\n\\n\\nUh, Leela, how you gonna meet your folks \\ntomorrow? We\\'ve already scheduled the \\nZookeeper for a 9am foiling at the museum.\\n\\n\\nThis is nothing. Back in high school \\nI used to drink a hundred cans of cola \\na week. Right up until my third heart \\nattack.\\n\\n\\nIf I were registered to vote, I send \\nthese clowns a message by staying home \\non election day and dressing up like \\na clown.\\n\\n\\nLook, Leela, even if you heard one talk, \\nthat doesn\\'t mean it\\'s intelligent. \\nI mean, parrots talk and we eat them, \\nright?\\n\\n\\nWell, what do you suggest? A daring \\ndaylight robbery of Fort Knox on elephant-back? \\nThat\\'s the dumbest thing I ever heard!\\n\\n\\nOh, I had a nightmare I was in the year \\n2000 and you guys never existed. I\\'m \\nso glad I\\'m awake now and you\\'re really \\nhere.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s a hell of a good parrot. Although, \\nI could get 500 lizards for the same \\nprice. Girls like swarms of lizards, \\nright?\\n\\n\\nI meant the sound Bigfoot just made. \\nHe\\'s been sighted a lot in this area \\nrecently. Just last week a blind hiker \\nfelt him!\\n\\n\\nNo, I can\\'t afford them. Being poor \\nsucks. What kind of world is this where \\nthey advertise things not everybody \\ncan afford?\\n\\n\\nHey, hey, cheer up. Not everyone turns \\nout like their parents. I mean, look \\nat me. My folks were honest hardworking \\npeople.\\n\\n\\nWow, I forgot about TV. Living free \\non the road, you realise how much better \\nlife is without it. Well, let\\'s see \\nwhat\\'s on.\\n\\n\\nWell it\\'s not right to make my dead \\npet an exhibit. That\\'s like digging \\nup Lassie and putting her on display \\nin the Louvre.\\n\\n\\nMaybe we\\'re all wearing magic rings \\nbut they\\'re invisible rings so we don\\'t \\neven realise it. Also you can\\'t feel \\nthe rings.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t need them. Not when I have my \\nantique videos, my bucket of fossilised \\nKFC and 50 million dollars worth of \\nanchovies.\\n\\n\\nNo way! I\\'m not letting my best friend \\nget recycled. Not for five cents, not \\nfor five hundred cents! Leela, I\\'ve \\ngot a plan!\\n\\n\\nValentine\\'s Day\\'s coming? Oh, crap! \\nI forgot to get a girlfriend again. \\nWell since neither of us has a date, \\nwhy don\\'t we...\\n\\n\\nNo, I did see a mermaid! She was wearing \\na tube top and she had a beautiful scaley \\ntail. And I think she had hair extensions.\\n\\n\\nI \\'unno. But the analysis showed it \\nwas printed on recycled toilet paper. \\nA squeezably soft paper used mainly \\nin the sewers.\\n\\n\\nYou haven\\'t won yet, Moivin! You didn\\'t \\nexpect us to even go to a museum, much \\nless steal this ancient heat-seeking \\nmissile.\\n\\n\\nI though that if you heard a familiar \\nvoice, it might help keep your mind \\ntogether. But, who knows if it really \\ngot through.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s so far-fetched about mermaids? \\nI mean, there\\'s all sorts of weird sea \\ncreatures here in the future. Like Dr. \\nZoidberg.\\n\\n\\nLeela, we\\'re missing the premiere.  \\nMy only goal in life was to attend a \\nHollywood shindig. Just pay the valet \\nthe two bucks.\\n\\n\\nFine, I\\'ve got a toast. To Captain Bender! \\nHe\\'s the best......at being a big jerk \\nand his big ugly face is as dumb as \\na butt.\\n\\n\\nWell sir, I spent all of ninth grade \\nstudying them. Except for that day when \\nmy eyeballs started to bleed. And in \\nmy opinion.\\n\\n\\nOh, it\\'s hopeless. I did something so \\ngreat that it won Leela\\'s heart and \\nI\\'ll never, ever know what it was. My \\nlife is empty.\\n\\n\\nAnd it was great! We got to see craters \\nand rocks and that one incredible rock \\nthat looked like a crater and, and these \\nfellas.\\n\\n\\nWe checked 90,000 cans of Slurm and \\nall we won was this junk.  I never wanna \\nsee another can of Slurm again. Man, \\nam I thirsty.\\n\\n\\nWait. Let me. Bender and I have our \\ndisagreements, but we\\'re still friends \\nand I\\'m gonna show him what that means. \\nTo the ship.\\n\\n\\nAww. There there. If it makes you feel \\nany better, his body was vapourised \\nso there\\'s no chance of him coming back \\nas a zombie.\\n\\n\\nNo we\\'re not. And as vice chairman, \\nI believe I speak for the entire board \\nwhen I issue this challenge to Mom. \\nLook at my butt!\\n\\n\\nAmy, you know how at first you like \\nchocolate but then you start to get \\ntired of it because it always wants \\nto hang out with you?\\n\\n\\nPsst, Leela. I\\'ve set up a time-proof \\nshelter in the closet. There\\'s only \\nroom for two, and you\\'re the one I wanna \\nshare it with.\\n\\n\\nLeela\\'s going nuts and I can\\'t save \\nher unless I learn more about her mysterious \\npast. Isn\\'t there anything else you \\ncan tell me?\\n\\n\\nThe moon? The moon moon? Wow! I\\'m gonna \\nbe a famous hero just like Neil Armstrong \\nand those other brave guys no one ever \\nheard of!\\n\\n\\nWho asked you to? I told you a hundred \\ntimes to stop treating me like a baby. \\nNow go. Go gather your nuts you nagging \\ngrasshopper.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s where I know her from. She\\'s \\nJenny McNeal. She was a character on \\na TV show back in the 20th century, \\nSingle Female Lawyer.\\n\\n Hey, I remember you. I \\nwas gonna vote for you one time. But \\nvoting isn\\'t cool so I stayed home alone \\nand got trashed on Listerine.\\n\\n\\nAww. That\\'s terrible, Leela. But imagine \\nthe look on their faces when you show \\nup with two friends who eat all the \\nhors d\\'oeuvres.\\n\\n\\nHow can you people be so blase? Here \\nyou are in the year 3000 or so, yet \\nyou just sit around like its the boring \\ntime I came from.\\n\\n\\nVoila. The greatest sandcastle ever \\nbuilt. This is the kind of castle King \\nArthur would have lived in -- If he \\nwere a fiddler crab.\\n\\n\\nYeah. If you rule out every guy with \\na lizard tongue or a low I.Q. or an \\nexplosive violent temper, of course \\nyou\\'re gonna be lonely.\\n\\n\\nI couldn\\'t help it. She loved me because \\nof the part of me that\\'s a slob and \\nI loved her because of the part of me \\nthat\\'s desperate.\\n\\n\\nPoor Bender. Without his brain he\\'s \\nbecome all quiet and helpful. We\\'ve \\ngot to go to the Central Bureaucracy \\nand get that disk back!\\n\\n\\nWhat?? Don\\'t ever say or think that \\nagain! Please. Just concentrate on staying \\nalive!  Fire! Look out!  Oh! You almost \\ngot neutered.\\n\\n\\nYou know what I like best about you, \\nUmbriel? You find me fascinating even \\nwhen I\\'m not claiming to be a jewel \\nthief or a lion tamer.\\n\\n\\nI already did! So, Leela, do you wanna \\nbe like us? Or do you wanna be like \\nAdlai with no severe mental or social \\nproblems whatsoever?\\n\\n\\nYep.  It was just a matter of knowing \\nthe secret of all TV shows; At the end \\nof the episode, everything\\'s always \\nright back to normal.\\n\\n\\nWell I don\\'t care if it was some dork \\nin a costume. For one brief moment I \\nfelt the heartbeat of creation. And \\nit was one with my own.\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s that flag from MTV! And Neil Armstrong\\'s \\nfootprint!  Hey! My foot\\'s bigger! Leela, \\nisn\\'t this the greatest thing you\\'ve \\never seen?\\n\\n\\nI was just working my way towards the \\nmedulla oblongata - control centre of \\nthe heart and lungs. And if I kill myself, \\nyou die with me.\\n\\n\\nIn my whole life this company was the \\nonly place I ever really felt at home. \\nIf being millionaires is more important \\nto you than our...\\n\\n\\nSure. I\\'m listed in the phone book so \\nonce I reveal my real name to you along \\nwith my home address and a copy of my \\nbirth certificate -\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s funny Bender. With you sick and \\nLeela blind only I know what really \\nwent on out there. Maybe someday I\\'ll \\ntell you the whole story.\\n\\n\\nOK, I gotta break down that gate, beat \\nup those three guards, steal that chopper \\nand rescue Bender.  Hey, I did it! Wait, \\nthat\\'s not me.\\n\\n\\nNegative, bossy meat creature. I know \\nnow what my primary function is: I am \\na battle-droid. Sworn to protect the \\nweak from crazy robots.\\n\\n\\nPeople of New New York. Take a lesson \\nfrom the 20th century. Stop all this \\npain-in-the-ass recycling and throw \\nyour garbage on the floor.\\n\\n\\nThe year 4000 is severely disappointing. \\nI miss the year 3000 when life was simple \\nand brains flew through space and everyone \\nate lasers.\\n\\n\\nBender, if you don\\'t open that can right \\nnow, your fear will own you, and nothing \\nthat can opener could ever do could \\nbe worse than that.\\n\\n\\nWell he didn\\'t check out. The ashtray\\'s \\nstill here.  Look, Nibbler\\'s caught \\nthe scent of vodka and motor oil! Go, \\nboy. Follow that stench.\\n\\n\\nLeela, we may not have much time left......so \\nlet\\'s spend all of it reminscing about \\nBender. He was like a big computer than \\nran on magic.\\n\\n\\nOf course I\\'ve been up all night! Not \\nbecause of caffine it was insomnia I \\ncouldn\\'t stop thinking about coffee \\nI need a nap.  Coffee time!\\n\\n\\nC\\'mon, Bender! It\\'s up to you to make \\nyour own decisions in life. That\\'s what \\nseparates people and robots from animals...and \\nanimal robots.\\n\\n\\nHey, a fish this fine belongs in a fish \\nnugget-style chunklet. And anyway, it\\'s \\nbigger than anything you\\'ve caught. \\nOw! My small intestine!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m literally angry with rage! Your \\nco-stars may be gone but we can still \\nget those episode tapes back for the \\nwhole world to see. Come on!\\n\\n\\nSo\\'s a peacock but you don\\'t eat it \\n\\'til it\\'s cooked. This has to be perfect. \\nI want you to hear exactly what I hear \\nwhen I think about you.\\n\\n\\nHello? Pizza delivery for ... Icy Wiener?! \\nAw, crud!  Here\\'s to another lousy Millennium! \\nOw!  I should have left you floating \\nin the toilet!\\n\\n\\nPst, Leela. you\\'ve got to get me out \\nof here. It\\'s horrible, eating scraps, \\nletting my waste drop wherever it falls \\nlike an animal in the zoo.\\n\\n\\nBut things are different this time. \\nBefore, she was demanding and possessive. \\nBut now she wants me to do stuff and \\nstay with her all the time.\\n\\n\\nAnd then, while they sat helplessly \\naround the campfire ... a demented knife-wielding \\nescaped lunatic libertarian zombie mutant \\nsnuck up and--\\n\\n\\nYou can\\'t give up hope just because \\nit\\'s hopeless. You gotta hope even more \\nand cover your ears and go \"blah blah \\nblah blah blah blah blah!\"  \\n\\n\\nThere but for the flip of a coin go \\nwe. So uh Leela, seeing how the universe \\nwasn\\'t destroyed, you wanna catch an \\nape fight? Y\\'know? Together?\\n\\n\\nMelllvar, you can\\'t let a TV show be \\nyour whole life. You can do anything \\nyou want. Look at Walter Koenig: After \\nStar Trek, he became an actor.\\n\\n\\nY\\'know, I\\'m the luckiest guy in the \\nwhole future. I\\'ve been given a second \\nchance and this time I\\'m not going to \\nbe a total loser.  What\\'s that?\\n\\n\\nThis is an emergency. Amy made Valentine\\'s \\nplans with some goon and I\\'m gonna be \\nstuck there, lonely and miserable. Will \\nyou be my date, please?\\n\\n\\nWow! We\\'ve got Manhattan all to ourselves! \\nI can finally do all the crazy stuff \\nI always dreamed of doing!  Howard Stern \\ns overrated!  Uh, oops!\\n\\n\\nI know you\\'ve rejected me a lot before \\nbut frankly I wasn\\'t sure we were right \\nfor each other either, but now I am! \\nSo how \\'bout a date tonight?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m so confused. The Bender I liked \\nturn out to be evil and the Bender I \\nhated was good. How can I live my life \\nwhen I can\\'t tell good from evil?\\n\\n\\nThis is awesome! We\\'re gonna be like \\npow-pow-pow, and they\\'re gonna be like \\n...  ... and then we\\'ll have pancakes \\nto celebrate and I\\'ll be like...\\n\\n\\nI just wished I could\\'ve showed you \\nguys how great they were. I may be rich \\nbut I still can\\'t buy back all the things \\nI miss from the 20th century.\\n\\n\\nOf all the parasites I\\'ve had over the \\nyears, these worms are among the - hell! \\nThey are the best! Leela, how can I \\never repay you for saving them?\\n\\n\\nI had Seymour \\'til he was three. That\\'s \\nwhen I knew him and that\\'s when I loved \\nhim.  I\\'ll never forget him. But he \\nforgot me a long long time ago.\\n\\n\\'S PHOTO\\nLeela! No!  Listen to me, you don\\'t \\nwant to lie in bed like a vegetable \\nand do nothing the rest of your life. \\nI\\'ve tried it. Bedsores hurt!\\n\\n\\nYeah, but in the year 3000, I had it \\nall. Several friends, a low-paying job, \\na bed in a robot\\'s closet. I envied \\nno man. But you wrecked everything.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m going down there to get my clover \\nback. Now some of the tunnels have metal \\nbars so I\\'ll need someone who\\'s good \\nat bending. Leela how \\'bout you?\\n\\n\\nHe decided not to let go.  I can\\'t believe \\nyou\\'re gone. I won\\'t! If I can\\'t reach \\nyou physically, I\\'ll just have to try \\nsomething desperately crazy!\\n\\n\\nSo none of you has ever had anchovies? \\nOh, man! You don\\'t know what you\\'re \\nmissing. They were all salty and oily \\nand they melted in your mouth and --\\n\\n\\nStand back and watch the master! This \\nSlurm can.  Now it\\'s garbage. These \\npapers.  Garbage. This picture of your \\nwife.  Pure garbage. Now you try it.\\n\\n\\nDon\\'t cry, Bender. Nobody really knows \\nwhat happens in a black hole. It\\'s possible \\nshe\\'s still alive in another dimension \\nsomewhere. Right, Professor?\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s that obnoxious monkey. He kept \\nme up all night with his constant thinking. \\nJust thinking and thinking. He\\'s trying \\nto make me look like an idiot.\\n\\n\\nAll this prolonged exposure to radiation \\nis making me thirsty.  Ah, if only there \\nwas some way of knowing which can had \\nthe winning bottle-cap inside.\\n\\n\\nThe important thing is we\\'re all together \\nfor Xmas. And even though I\\'m surrounded \\nby robots and monsters and old people, \\nI\\'ve never felt more at home.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s this? This is the same toy surprise \\nI got last time!  I can\\'t work under \\nthese conditions. And without me there \\nis no mission. I am the mission!\\n\\n\\nYeah yeah, but I can\\'t pass up a chance \\nto learn the answers to the greatest \\nquestions of all time.  Is it true that \\npost-it stamp glue is made up of -\\n\\n\\nSure! It\\'s the price of a cheese pizza \\nand a large soda back where I used to \\nwork, Panucci\\'s Pizza.  It\\'s the price \\nof a cheese pizza and a large soda --\\n\\n\\nFirst person on Mars?? I should have \\nbeen the first person on Mars! He stole \\nmy clover, he stole my name and he stole \\nmy life!  And now he broke my hand.\\n\\n\\nLeela, about the wedding. I don\\'t know \\nwhat I did to make you love me, and \\nI don\\'t think I tricked you into it, \\nbut maybe I did. And if I did, I\\'m sorry.\\n\\n\\nLet me ask you something: Has anyone \\never discovered a hole in nothing with \\nmonsters in it?  \\'Cause if I\\'m the first, \\nI want them to call it \"a Fry Hole\".\\n\\n\\nListen Morgan, We\\'re through, you\\'re \\nan evil heartless woman and I never \\nwanna see you again. However would you \\nhelp us get Bender back for old times \\nsake?\\n\\n\\nWell if you\\'re going to be Earthicans \\nwe\\'ll have to teach you. How about your \\npizzeria plays a game against Planet \\nExpress? Oh but you\\'ll need nine players.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve been sitting right here. I picked \\nup my life exactly where I left off \\na thousand years ago. Now if you\\'ll \\nexcuse me it\\'s 8 o\\'clock. Time to get \\nbiz-ay!\\n\\n\\nEverything was going great. Then all \\nof a sudden, she\\'s talking about hanging \\nout. Hangin out? She\\'s getting way too \\nserious. I\\'m not a one woman man, Leela.\\n\\n\\nTime to re-educate you duncebags. We\\'ll \\nstart with US presidents.  This is our \\nfirst president, George Washington. \\nLet\\'s review. Who was our first president?\\n\\n\\nBefore we deliver these hearts, I\\'m \\ngonna find the one that sums up my feelings \\nfor you!  \"I Love You.\" Hmm, too conventional. \\n\"You\\'re My Man.\" Ooo so close!\\n\\n\\nWhat is the meaning of this? We\\'ve got \\na delivery people, let\\'s move, let\\'s \\nmove!  Amy? Mission profile?  Interesting, \\ninteresting. Dr Zoidberg, mission bag?\\n\\n\\n...who slurped Hudge the Dewy, who enjoyed \\na soup composed principally of Throm \\nthe Chunky, do solemnly swear to rule \\nwith honour and insanity - uh, integrity!\\n\\n\\nDearly beloved, we are here today to \\nremember Bender, taken from us in the \\nprime of life, when he was crushed by \\na runaway semi, driven by the Incredible \\nHulk.\\n\\n\\nHmm, finding God, that - that\\'s important, \\nyeah. But you know what might be a treat \\nfor everyone? If you let me use the \\ntelescope to find my lost friend Bender.\\n\\n\\nWhat?! That\\'s not fair. I deserve the \\nsame respect any other college dropout \\ngets. By God, I\\'m gonna enroll here \\nat Mars University and drop out all \\nover again!\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s right. And I think you\\'ll find \\nthat a little knowledge is a dangerous \\nthing!  OK, better think of a new plan. \\nCome on, Fry, think!  Thinking...thinking...\\n\\n\\nOh, it\\'s Bender\\'s apartment. He put \\nin carpeting yesterday so now my head \\nhits the ceiling. Hey, do you realise \\nyou\\'re standing at a weird angle?  Now \\nyou\\'re OK.\\n\\n\\nThen I\\'ll prove I\\'m alive! By telling \\nyou something only I could know. There\\'s \\na surprise for you in my locker. I got \\nit at a Swedish novelty shop before \\nwe left.\\n\\n\\nHey, I\\'m starting to get the hang of \\nthis game. The blerns are loaded, the \\ncount\\'s three blerns and two anti-blerns \\nand the infield blern rule is in effect, \\nright?\\n\\n\\nSo it\\'s left, left, right-- Wait! I \\nhave a better idea! I\\'ll go out and \\nget her the perfect Xmas present. Something \\nso great she\\'ll never want to be unhappy \\nagain.\\n\\n You\\'re right. I\\'m never gonna \\nsee him again. I know he was evil and \\non more than one occasion he, he actually \\nstole my blood.  But still, I wish I \\nhad Bender back.\\n\\n\\nAww, don\\'t cry foreign people. I used \\nto work in a pizzeria and as soon as \\nI stop hallucinating and blasting puke, \\nI\\'m gonna teach you to sell pizza - \\nEarth style!\\n\\n\\nPoor Bender, you\\'re seeing things. You\\'ve \\nbeen drinking too much, or too little, \\nI forget how it works with you. Anyway, \\nyou haven\\'t drunk exactly the right \\namount.\\n\\n\\nHey yeah! Maybe it is still there! Underground \\nin the ruins of Old New York. Helping \\nsome ant defeat another ant or helping \\nsome piece of dirt turn it\\'s luck around.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ve never been able to put into words \\nhow I feel about you. But somewhere \\namong these trillions of hearts, those \\nwords must already exist. And I\\'m gonna \\nfind them.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m doing my job -- there\\'s Amy. I spend \\na few hours selecting a candy from the \\nmachine -- there\\'s Amy. I wake up the \\nmorning after sleeping with Amy -- there\\'s \\nAmy!\\n\\n\\nI hate the Planet of the Moochers. They \\ntake you out for a drink, but when the \\ncheck comes, their wallet\\'s always in \\ntheir other pants - which they borrowed \\nfrom me!\\n\\n\\nBut I\\'m not a robot like you. I don\\'t \\nlike having discs crammed into me. Unless \\nthey\\'re Oreos - and then only in the \\nmouth! Don\\'t you understand? I\\'m gonna \\ndie here!\\n\\n\\nThanks, Leela. From now on, I\\'ll take \\nall the help you\\'re willing to give. \\nI know you just want what\\'s best for \\nme.  Ow! What was that for?  Hey, come \\non!  That hurt!\\n\\n\\nFor starters, only use quality ingredients. \\nCase in point: No more live bees.  Oregano \\nworks equally well. And when you put \\npizzas in the oven, don\\'t get in with \\nthem.\\n\\n\\nWell, I spent every penny I had but \\nI bet Leela\\'s gonna love you.  Hey, \\nyou\\'re quite the talker, aren\\'t you? \\nShut the hell up!  Ow!  Stupid bird! \\nI know where you live.\\n\\n\\nHis name was Seymour. He was once intimate \\nwith the leg of a wandering saxaphonist. \\nHe had wet dog smell, even when dry. \\nAnd he was not above chasing the number \\n29 bus.\\n\\n\\nNo, Professor, don\\'t give up. There \\nwere plenty of times in my century when \\nI was gonna give up but I never did. \\nNever! Hey, are you even listening to \\nme? Oh, I give up!\\n\\n\\nIt\\'s not filth. It\\'s a glorious monument \\nto the achievements of the 20th century. \\nLook! A real Beanie Baby.  Oh! A Mr. \\nSpock collector\\'s plate!  Some Bart \\nSimpson dolls!\\n\\n\\nLook, Leela, I don\\'t understand this \\nworld but you obviously do, so I give \\nup. If you really think I should be \\na delivery boy, I\\'ll do it.  Your chip. \\nWhat are you doing?\\n\\n\\nHey, my girlfriend had one of those! \\nActually it wasn\\'t her\\'s it was her \\ndad\\'s. Actually she wasn\\'t my girlfriend. \\nShe just lived next door and never closed \\nher curtains.\\n\\n\\nHello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! \\nAw, crud! I always thought at this point \\nin my life I\\'d be the one making the \\ncrank calls!  Here\\'s to another lousy \\nmillennium.\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause I think Alkazar\\'s hding something. \\nListen Leela, you may not like it, you \\nmay not believe it, you may not wanna \\nhear it but Alkazar\\'s a jerk, he\\'s bad \\nfor you. He -\\n\\n\\nI can\\'t believe this. Bender is supposed \\nto murder his closest friend, which \\nI thought was me. But he went straight \\nfor you. He didn\\'t even try to second-degree \\nmurder me.\\n\\n\\nMost important of all is the big screen \\nTV. Human families need a TV when they\\'re \\neating so they don\\'t have to talk to \\neach other.  Ah, the Earthican pasttime, \\nblernsball!\\n\\n\\nI\\'m walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! \\nI\\'m walking on sunshine! Ooo-oo-ooh! \\nAt a boy Seymour! Right here waiting \\nfor me as always! Just like that huge \\nmushroom in my shower!\\n\\n \\nExcuse me? You can\\'t park here. The \\nparking area\\'s over there.  Wow nice \\ntube!  Hey. Hey what\\'s the big idea? \\nStop abducting me. Why does your vanity \\nplate say \"Probe 1\"?\\n\\n\\nLucy Liubot, if I don\\'t survive the \\ncorn I want you to know that I love \\nyou as much as a man can love a computerised \\nimage of gorgeous celebrity. Which it \\nturns out is a lot.\\n\\n\\nYes there is Bender. Bender was a lot \\nof things to a lot of people, but looking \\nback, the number one thing I can say \\nabout him is this, and simply this: \\nBender was my friend.\\n\\n\\nHmm, I remember the square dancing stomachs, \\nalthough that might have been a milanta \\ncommerical. Wait! The brains! I do remember! \\nBut no one else does. They said I was \\ncrazy.\\n\\n\\nI just saw something incredibly cool. \\nA big floating ball that lit up with \\nevery colour of the rainbow, plus some \\nnew ones that were so beautiful I fell \\nto my knees and cried.\\n\\n\\nLeela, there\\'s something I\\'ve wanted \\nto tell you for a long time but every \\ntime I try I get nervous and my mouth \\nfeels like it\\'s stuffed with peanut \\nbutter, even when it\\'s not.\\n\\n\\nOh, right. I was supposed to assign \\nyou a job. Let me just get your career \\nchip installed.  Hold out your palm. \\nWhat are you scared of? It\\'s just like \\ngetting your hand pierced.\\n\\n\\nWell, a wonderful girl loves me. But \\nI need to know if it\\'s really me she \\nloves, or just what you worms have made \\nof me. That\\'s why with all due respect, \\nI\\'m asking you to leave.\\n\\n\\nYou\\'re right Professor. We might not \\nbe a traditional family like the Murphy\\'s \\nnext door or the lesbian coven across \\nthe street but we are a family, and \\nThat Guy understands that.\\n\\n\\nHey, don\\'t blame me. You tried to force \\nGuenter to be a human but he\\'s an animal. \\nHe belongs in the wild. Or in the circus \\non one of those tiny tricycles. Now \\nthat\\'s entertainment.\\n\\n\\nHello? Pizza delivery for......Icy Wiener?! \\nAw crud! I always thought at this point \\nin my life I\\'d be the one making the \\ncrank calls!  Here\\'s to another lousy \\nMillenium.  What the?\\n\\n\\nI nominate That Guy. Not just because \\nhe has a suit but because he knows about \\nbusiness and stuff and he has a tie. \\nMy shares still count if they went \\nthrough the washing machine right?\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t get it, Michelle. The last time \\nI saw you, you were doing great. You \\nhad just dumped me and you were well \\non your way to getting you life back \\non track. Why\\'d you freeze yourself?\\n\\n\\nI hid my seven leaf clover in this very \\nrecord jacket so my brother Yancy wouldn\\'t \\nget it.  Here goes.  It\\'s gone!  the \\nwhole place has been cleaned out! Yancy \\nstole my clover! That thief!\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s so wonderful about Leela being \\nnormal? The rest of us aren\\'t normal \\nand that\\'s what makes us great. Like \\nDr. Zoidberg: He\\'s a weird monster who \\nsmells like he eats garbage and does.\\n\\n\\nWhat\\'s the point of Xmas when everyone \\nyou know died a thousand years ago? \\nI\\'m the lonliest person on Earth.  Hey, \\nLeela, how \\'bout a little sympathy here, \\nhuh?  Yoiks! What was that about?\\n\\n\\nWait a second! This is Panucci\\'s! I \\nused to work in this exact pizzeria! \\nAnd for your information lady, this \\nwas not just used to paddle my butt, \\nit was also used to move pizzas and \\ncrush rats.\\n\\n\\nWell, sure, but not in our dreams. Only \\non TV and radio. And in magazines and \\nmovies and at ball games and on buses \\nand milk cartons and t-shirts and written \\nin the sky. But not in dreams. No siree!\\n\\n\\nAs vice chairman of Planet Express I\\'d \\nlike to say a few words. There comes \\na time for every man who becomes rich \\nand deserts his friends, when he goes \\nback how it was. For me, that time is \\nnow....\\n\\n\\nY\\'know, I guess it should be but actually \\nI\\'m glad. I had nothing to live for \\nin my old life. I was broke, I had a \\nhumiliating job and I was beginning \\nto suspect my girlfriend might be cheating \\non me.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m glad you\\'re all here. I wanted to \\nintroduce you to my on-again-off-again \\ngirlfriend of the past thousand years, \\nMichelle.  Michelle, this is Leela. \\nThis is Bender.  The professor.  Hermes \\nand Amy.\\n\\n\\nWow Bender. Are you and the ship an \\nitem? I mean I know you\\'re both items \\nbut...how can you date a ship anyway? \\nIt\\'d be like me dating a really fat \\nlady. And living inside her. And she\\'d \\nbe all like...\\n\\n\\nGosh my old neighbourhood!  That\\'s the \\nbench where I found some shirts!  That \\nfire hydrant! In summer we\\'d light it \\non fire! On that corner, some guy with \\na bushy beard handed out a socialist \\nnewsletter!\\n\\n\\n\\'Cause it-it taught me so much. Like \\nhow you should accept people, whether \\nthey be black, white, Klingon or even \\nfemale. But most importantly, when I \\ndidn\\'t have any friends, it made me \\nfeel like maybe I did.\\n\\n\\nWhat are we supposed to do for money? \\nAll I\\'ve got is my frequent taffy eater\\'s \\ncard, my first moustache......and this \\npicture of me and my old girlfriend, \\nMichelle, and that ski instructor she \\nwas just friends with.\\n\\n\\nEvery time something good happens to \\nme you say it\\'s some kind of madness, \\nor I\\'m drunk, or I ate too much candy. \\nWell I saw a real mermaid and I wish \\nfor once my friends would have decency \\nand kindness to believe me.\\n\\n\\nNo! Drugs are for losers and hypnosis \\nis for losers with big, weird eyebrows. \\nI don\\'t know what amazing thing I did \\nyou make you love me but, whatever it \\nwas, we\\'re married now. We\\'ve got the \\nrest of our lives to work -\\n\\n\\nPlease. Give me a chance to be romantic \\non my own. I\\'ve got a baggy of massage \\noil, and I\\'m gonna give you my super \\nback rub, just like a I used to give \\nAmy when I was going out with her, and \\nshe always seemed... - Uh-oh!\\n\\n\\nThe Ronco Record Vault! Yancy\\'ll never \\nget his hands on you in here or my money \\nback.  Ah The Breakfast Club soundtrack! \\nMan I can\\'t wait til I\\'m old enough \\nto feel ways about stuff!  Stay safe \\nclover. I may need you again someday.\\n\\n\\nAnd you made me feel like a jerk for \\ntrusting you. Just like when my friend \\nRichie swore he wasn\\'t taking drugs \\nand then he sold me my mom\\'s VCR and \\nthen later I found out he was taking \\ndrugs. You make me ashamed to be your \\nfriend.\\n\\n\\nDear Horse God, I know I don\\'t usually \\npray to you, sometimes I doubt you even \\nexist. But if you\\'re willing to grant \\nme luck, please, stamp your hoof once. \\nCome on number six move it!  Don\\'t \\ndo that! What are you -  Man it\\'s contagious!\\n\\n\\nI never told anybody this but a thousand \\nyears ago I used to look up at the moon \\nand dream about being an astronaut. \\nI just didn\\'t have the grades. Nor the \\nphysical endurance. Plus I threw up \\na lot and nobody liked spending a week \\nwith me.\\n\\n Every Christmas my mom would \\nget a fresh goose for goose burgers \\nand my dad would whip up his special \\neggnog out of bourbon and ice cubes. \\nThis dumb holiday just makes me think \\nof all the things I left behind. Let\\'s \\njust stop talking about Xmas.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know. This place is great and \\nall but its just so artificial. The \\ngravity, the air, the gophers. You might \\nas well stay on Earth.  That\\'s what \\nI came to see! I wanna go out there \\nand jump around like an astronaut. Screw \\nthis phoney stuff!\\n\\n\\nNo, it\\'s my fault too. I\\'m sure I threw \\nout more than my share of that trash \\nup there. Also, one month my toilet \\nbroke and it just went straight in the \\ngarbage can.  Leela was right. The people \\nof the 20th century were idiotic slobs. \\nEspecially me.\\n\\n\\nTrust me on this. While other people \\nwere out living their lives, I wasted \\nmine watching TV, because deep down \\nI knew it might one day help me save \\nthe world. Plus, I would have lost my \\nWorkman\\'s Comp if I hadd gone outside. \\nNow just read these cue cards.\\n\\n\\nYou might as well put that chequebook \\naway, because I\\'ve discovered something \\neven more important. My friends. And \\nthey aren\\'t worth even a penny to me. \\nThat\\'s why these anchovies are going \\non a pizza, so I can share the food \\nI love with the people I like.\\n\\n\\nLeela cried for her lost love as Fry \\nlay dead under the heavy bookcase. The \\nBig Brain laughed in triumph......Then, \\nfor no reason, he left Earth forever. \\nThe end.  There!  Now he\\'s trapped in \\na book I wrote: A crummy world of plot \\nholes and spelling errors.\\n\\n\\nI know, and I\\'ve grown to accept that. \\nNow I\\'m more interested in that new \\npizza parlour across the street. Kinda \\nmakes me pine for my days as a pizza \\ndelivery boy. \"Here\\'s you pizza,\" I\\'d \\nsay. \"I didn\\'t order any,\" they\\'d say. \\nAnd then I\\'d be off to my next adventure.\\n\\n Destiny has cheated me by \\nforcing me to decide upon,\\n\\nThe woman that I idolise,\\n\\nOr the hands of an automaton,\\n\\nWithout these hands I can\\'t complete the opera that was captivating \\nher,\\n\\nBut if I keep them,\\n\\nAnd she marries him,\\n\\nThen he probably won\\'t want me dating her.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI know I should but I just can\\'t. Remember \\nwhen I had those stomach worms that \\nmade me smart? I could play the holophonor \\nand it made Leela like me.  Hey Bender, \\nas long as you know, I have a holophonor \\nrecital Tuesday and I\\'d really like \\nto have somebody there. Please?\\n\\n\\nIn my time, we didn\\'t depend on high-tech \\ngadgets like you do. We didn\\'t need \\na mechanical washing unit to wash our \\nclothes. We just used a washing machine. \\nAnd look: You don\\'t need an electric \\ncan-opener to feed yourself. All you \\nneed is a trusty Swiss Army knife.  \\nOw!  \\n\\n\\nOh.  Thank you. Y\\'know, when I was first \\nasked to make a film about my nephew, \\nProfessor Farnsworth, I thought \"Why \\nshould I?\" Then later Leela made the \\nfilm. But if I had made the film, you \\ncould bet there would have been a lot \\nmore topless women on motorcycles!  \\nRoll film!\\n\\n\\nThe moon was like this awesome, romantic, \\nmysterious thing, hanging up there in \\nthe sky where you could never reach \\nit, no matter how much you wanted to. \\nBut you\\'re right. Once you\\'re actually \\nhere it\\'s just a big dull rock. I guess \\nI just wanted you to see it through \\nmy eyes, the way I used to.\\n\\n\\nBigfoot? Is that you? I\\'m not like the \\nothers Bigfoot. I see through your monster \\ncoatings to the gentle loner inside. \\nI bet you have a wounded racoon friend \\nthat you tenderly nurse back to health \\nand go......and in the end they shoot \\nyou. But you teach us about things. \\nOh, it\\'s a flying saucer. \\n\\n\\nMy fellow fish monsters. Far be it for \\nme to question your stupid civilisation \\nor its dumb customs. But is squeezing \\neach others brains out with a giant \\nnutcracker really going to solve anything? \\nDr. Zoidberg is my friend. And though \\na woman has come between us, I say we\\'ll \\nalways remain friends. And you know \\nwhy?  One reason.\\n\\n\\nThat\\'s it! You can only take my money \\nfor so long before you take it all, \\nand I say enough.  I\\'ve got one dollar \\nleft, and this one I\\'m holding onto! \\nOh no you don\\'t!  I may not know much \\nabout horses but I know a lot about \\ndoing anything for one dollar!  If you \\nthink bad luck can defeat me then you \\ndon\\'t know my name is Philip J -\\n\\n\\nAww. Poor little guy. You look like \\nyou haven\\'t eaten in a month. Here......but \\nif Mr Panucci asks, your name is Seynour \\nAsses!  I like you Seymour, you\\'re not \\nconstantly judging me like all the other \\ndogs - are you? Nah. We understand each \\nother.  People think you\\'re a dumb mutt \\nwho smells bad, can\\'t find a girlfriend \\nand has a crummy job. But you\\'re keepin\\' \\nit real and call no man \"Mister.\"  Well \\ngoodbye.  Live long and prosper.\\n\\n\\nI\\'ll be whatever I wanna do! That Guy \\nwas the greatest businessman that ever \\nlived and before his mysterious death \\nhe taught me everything he knew.  But \\nsome things I had to learn myself.  \\nI learned that money is fine but in \\nthe end what counts is people... ...People \\nyou love... ...You can\\'t put a price \\non that... So I\\'m giving up control \\nof the company... ...to a man of enourmous \\nexperience... ...Professor... ...Hubert \\nFarnsworth.\\n\\n\\nHell, no. If I stopped to think ahead, \\nI wouldn\\'t be Emperor. And I wouldn\\'t \\neven be here in the year 3000. It\\'s \\njust like the story of the grasshopper \\nand the octopus. All year long the grasshopper \\nkept burying acorns for winter while \\nthe octopus mooched off his girlfriend \\nand watched TV. But then the winter \\ncame and the grasshopper died and the \\noctopus ate all his acorns and also \\nhe got a racecar. Is any of this getting \\nthrough to you?'"
